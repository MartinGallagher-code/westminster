# TODO — Next Steps

1. **Configurable comparison page** — Allow users to configure which documents to compare side-by-side on a topic. Consider pre-sets (e.g. "Westminster family", "Continental Reformed") and/or a custom selector for picking documents.

2. ~~**Simplify top-bar navigation** — Remove the individual document shortcut links from the top bar (too many). Replace with a drop-down menu that shows the full name of each document.~~ ✓

3. **Document landing pages** — On the main page for each document, add a description of the document, its history, historical context, authorship, date, etc.

4. ~~**Expand document name abbreviations** — Use full document names where it makes sense, rather than only showing abbreviations.~~ ✓

5. **Missing scripture proof texts** — Some scripture references do not have the full Bible text attached. Audit and fill in the gaps.

6. **SHC section formatting** — The Second Helvetic Confession has sections that start with all-caps text. These should be preceded by a line break and treated as the start of new sections.

7. ~~**Align section/question counts on document pages** — On the main page for each document, the number of sections or questions does not appear at a consistent distance, causing a staggered/ragged layout. Fix alignment.~~ ✓

8. ~~**Remove top-level "go to" functionality** — Remove the top-level "go to" feature for jumping to a document and number.~~ ✓

9. ~~**Rename "Compare All Three" button** — On the home page, the "Compare All Three" button no longer makes sense now that there are more than three documents. Rename it to something like "Compare Documents".~~ ✓

10. **Update scripture index** — Ensure the scripture index includes all scripture references from all documents.

11. ~~**Full document names on search results** — On the search results page, use the full name of the document rather than its abbreviation.~~ ✓

12. ~~**Remove section symbol (§)** — Remove the "section" symbol wherever it is used on the site.~~ ✓
