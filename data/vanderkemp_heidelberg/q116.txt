Q.   116.   Why  is  prayer  necessary  for  Christians? 

A.  Because  il  is  that  chief  part  of  thankfulness  which  God  re- 
quires of  us;  and  also  because  God  will  p;ive  his  grace  and  Holy 
Spirit  to  those  only,  who  with  sincere  desires  continually  ask  them 
of  him,  and  are  thankful  for  them.
