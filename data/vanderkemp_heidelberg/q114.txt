Q.    113.    What  doth  the  tenth  commandment  require  of  us  ? 

A.  That  even  the  smallest  inclination  or  thought  contrary  to  any 
of  God's  commands,  never  rise  in  our  hearts  ;  but  that  at  all 
times  we  hate  all  sin  with  our  whole  hearts,  and  delight  in  all  right- 
eousness. 

Q.  114.  But  can  those  who  are  converted  to  God,  perfectly  kc</> 
these  commands  ? 

A.  No;  but  even  the  holiest  men,  while  in  this  life,  have  only 
small  beginnings  of  this  obedience,  yet  so,  that  with  a  sincere  reso- 
lution, they  begin  to  live,  not  only  according  to  some,  but  all  the 
commands  of  God. 

Q.  115.  Why  will  God  then  have  all  the  commands  so  strictly  preach- 
ed, since  no  man  in  this  life  can  keep  them  ? 


XLIV.  LORDS  DAY.  Q.  113—115.  375 

A.  First,  that  all  our  lifetime,  we  may  learn  more  and  more  to 
know  our  sinful  nature,  and  thus  become  more  earnest  in  seek'i.g 
the  remission  of  sin,  and  righteousness  in  Christ ;  likewise,  that  we 
constantly  endeavour  and  pray  to  God  for  the  grace  of  the  Holy 
Spirit,  that  we  m:y  become  more  and  more  conformable  to  the 
image  of  God,  till  we  arrive  at  the  perfection  proposed  to  us  in  a 
life  to  come.

JL  have  seen  an  end  of  all  perfection  :  but  thy  commandment  is 
exceeding  broad,"  saith  David,  Psalm  cxix.  96  No  visible  things 
are  so  perfect,  that  they  are  eternal  and  incorruptible  ;  "  for  the 
things  which  are  seen  are  temporal,"  2  Cor.  iv.  18,  nor  are  they  so 
perfect  that  they  have  "not  their  Hmits  ;  they  could  otherwise  afford 
human  beings  a  perfect  satisfaction,  and  would  not  be  accompanied 
with  any  sorrow.  Every  man  can  see  that  they  have  their  limits, 
and  might  be  more  perfect.  Although  a  man  should  be  ever  so 
much  enamoured  of  his  prosperity,  he  will  nevertheless  experience 
at  times  an  interruption  of  his  pleasure.  God  alone  is  infinitely 
perfect,  and  since  his  law  is  an  expression  of  his  perfection,  there- 
fore his  commandment  is  also  exceedingly  broad-  He  who  medi- 
tates in  it  day  and  night  will  find  continually  more  and  more  that 
there  are  unfathomable  depths  in  it,  his  delight  in  it  will  not  cease, 
nor  be  interrupted,  but  continually  renewed.  The  sweet  Psalm- 
ist hath  shown  this  in  the  hundred  and  nineteenth  psalm,  his 
heait  scarcely  indites  a  single  verse,  but  in  order  to  express 
his  pleasure  in  the  commands  of  the  Lord  :  for  '*  the  law  of  the 
Lord  is  perfect,  converting  the  soul,  making  wise  the  simple,  and 
rejoicing  the  heart ;"  thus  he  speaks,  Psalm  xix.  7,  3.  A  man  may 
find  all  that  he  must  either  believe  or  do  in  the  law  ;  it  forbids  all 
that  is  sinful ;  yea,  like  the  whole  word,  Heb.  iv.  12,  the  command- 
ment is  "  a  discerner  of  the  thoughts  and  intents  of  the  heart,"  "  The 
law  is  spiritual,"  saith  Paul,  Rom.  vii.  14.  It  extendeth  to  the  in- 
most desires  of  a  man's  spirit,  when  it  saith,  "  Tnou  shalt  not 
covet,"  &c. 

If  the  Lawgiver  had  forbidden  only  murder,  adultery,  stealing,, 
and  bearing  false  witness,  thf  sinner,  who  knows  neither  the  corrup- 
tion of  his  heart,  nor  the  perfect  holiness  of  God,  would  imagine 
that  the  outward  observation  of  these  commands  would  be  sufficient : 
but  the  Lord  prevents  this,  when  he  forbids  in  this  commandment 
also  the  unholiness  and  sinful  desires  of  bis  spirit. 

The  instructor  proposes  here  two  particulars  for  our  consideration  s 


376      THE  TENTH  COMMANDMENT  EXPLAINED, 

I.  The  nature  of  the  tenth  commandment,  Question  113. 

II.  1  he  end  of  the  giving  of  the  law,  Question  114,  115. 

1.  The  Lawgiver  forbids  "coveting  our  neighbour's  house,  wife> 
manservant,  maidservant,  ox,  ass,  and  aught  that  is  our  neighbour's," 
or,  belongs  to  him.  A  certain  proof,  that  this  commandment  re- 
lates to  loving  our  neighbour,  and  so  belongs  to  the  second  table. 
Yet  we  need  not  scruple  to  refer  it  also  to  the  first  table,  with  the 
catechism,  which  saith,  in  order  to  explain  this  commandment, 
"  that  even  the  smallest  inclination  or  thought  contrary  to  any  of 
God's  commandments  should  never  arise  in  our  hearts,"  See.  Paul 
saith,  Rom.  xiii.  10,  "  Love  worketh  no  ill  to  his  neighbour:  there- 
fore love  is  the  fulfilling  of  the  law."  Consequently  the  commands 
of  the  second  table  respect  also  the  commands  of  the  first,  which 
belong  also  to  the  law,  and  are  fulfilled  by  keeping  the  second  tablet 

The  Lawgiver  saith  twice,  "  Thou  Shalt  not  covet,"  once  with 
respect  to  our  neighbour's  house,  and  again  with  respect  to  his  wife. 
Surely  not-  in  order  to  give  us  here  two  distinct  commands,  as  the 
Papists  assert,  which  we  refuted,  when  we  divided  the  law  into  two 
tables,  in  treating  on  the  93d  question  :  but  the  Lord  repeats  the 
word  covet,  in  order  to  teach  us,  that  it  ought  to  be  repeated  before 
every  object,  which  is  exhibited  here,  and  to  manifest  his  earnest- 
ness in  forbidding  covetousness,  that  the  person  who  is  in  covenant 
with  him  may  beware  of  it  the  more.  "  Coveting."  (or  desiring) 
we  know  is  that  active  power  of  the  soul,  which  goeth  forth  with 
delight  and  inclination  to  that,  which  is  represented  by  the  under- 
standing as  good,  whether  it  be  a  real,  or  an  apparent  good  ;  for 
we  cannot  covet  aught  that  is  represented  to  us  as  evil,  but  we  have 
an  aversion  from  it.  When  now  the  Lawgiver  saith,  "  thou  shalt 
not  covet,"  he  speaks  not  then  of  a  natural  desire  to  necessary 
things  ;  for  he  himself  hath  implanted  such  a  desire  in  man  for  his 
wellbeing ;  much  less  doth  he  forbid  a  good  desire  of  his  favour  and 
fellowship,  since  he  commands  this,  Psalm  Ixxxi.  10,  and  will  ful- 
fil it,  Isaiah  Iv.  1,  but  he  forbids  a  sinful  desire. 

This  sinful  desire  (or  coveting)  is  "  the  smallest  inclination  or 
thought,  which  ariseth  in  our  hearts,  contrary  to  any  of  God's  com- 
■mandments,"  according  to  the  explanation  of  the  instructor,  and  it 
is  thus  the  beginning  of  every  sin,  which  is  forbidden  in  the  other 
commandments.  Paul  also  teaches  us  this,  when  he  saith,  that  "  he 
was  convinced  by  this  tenth  commandment  of  all  his  sins,  "  Rom. 
vii.  7,  8.  Thus  also  the  Saviour  teacheth,  that  "  looking  on  a  wo- 
man to  lust  after  her,  is  committing  adultery  with  her  in  our  heart," 
!S\d*.  v.  2;8.      Achan  was  enticed  by  hie   lust  to  steal  of  that  which 


XLIV.  LORD'S  DAY.  Q.  113—115.  377 

had  been  devoted,  Joshua  vii  21.  And  so  this  commandment  serves 
to  explain  the  foregoing-  commandments,  by  teaching  us,  that  God 
forbids  not  only  the  outward  sinful  actions,  but  even  the  desires  of 
the  soul  to  those  sins. 

But  this  commandment  doubtless  forbids  also  that  which  is  not  so 
particularly  intended  in  the  other  commands,  and  that  is  u  discon- 
tentment," whereby  a  person  craves  besides  what  he  hath  himself, 
and  with  which  he  ought  to  be  contented,  also  the  property  of 
another,  although  not  by  unrig'  teous  methods,  and  when  he  cannot 
obtain  it  so,  is  not  satisfied  }  as  Ahab  coveted  the  vineyard  of  Na- 
both,  and  was  willing  to  give  him  a  better  for  it,  or  the  value  of  it 
in  money  ;  but  upon  being  refused,  was  displeased,  1  Kings  xxi. 
1—6. 

But  let  us  view  this  covetousness,  which  hath  brought  depravity 
into  the  world,  near  at  hand,  1,  with  respect  to  its  root,  2,  with 
respect  to  its  branches  and  fruits,  and  3,  with  respect  to  the  degrees 
of  its  growth. 

The  rootsin  of  covetousness  is,  (a)  that  the  sinner  lacks  the  all- 
sufficient  God,  who  alone  can  fill  and  satisfy  the  heart  fully  :  M  He 
comes  short  of  the  glory  of  God  by  sin,"  Rom.  iii.  23,  and  "  is 
alienated  from  the  life  of  God."  Eph.  iv.  18,  whereby  his  soul,  being 
like  an  empty  vessel,  seeks  to  be  filled,  and  pants  insatiably  after  all 
that  appears  to  him  honourable,  pleasant  and  profitable,  and  so  the 
sinner  is  like  "  a  greedy  dog,  and  he  can  never  have  enough,"  as 
the  Lord  speaks  of  the  watchmen  of  his  people,  Isaiah  Jvi  11,  12. 
(b)  Covetousness  proceeds  also  from  an  irregular  selflove,  by  which 
a  person  makes  himself  the  only  object  of  whatsoever  he  doth,  and 
therefore  endeavours  to  heap  up  for  himself  whatsoever  appears  to 
him  desirable.  The  apostle  teacheth  that  those,  w  ho  are  "  lovers 
of  themselves,  are  lovers  of  pleasures  more  than  of  God."  2 
Tim.  iii.  2,  4.  (c)  This  root  comprehends  also  pride,  from  which 
ariseth  an  imagination,  that  we  deserve  more  than  we  have,  yea, 
what  our  neighbour  hath.  It  was  this  pride,  which  induced  Absa- 
lom to  covet  his  father's  kingdom,  2  Sam.  xv.  1,  6.  (d)  Eartnly- 
mindedness  excites  also  to  sinful  covetousness  ;  for  this  renders  a 
person  so  sottishly  addicted  to  "  the  lust  of  the  flesh,  the  Just  of 
the  eyes,  and  the  pride  of  life,  that  he  esteems  his  belly  his  God, 
places  his  glory  in  his  shame,  and  minds  only  earthly  things."  See 
1  John  ii.  16,  and  Philip,  iii,  19.  It  cannot  be  otherwise,  but  that 
these  roots  must  bear  many  branches  of  gall  and  wormwood.  For 
they  excite  the  desires  (a)  to  forbidden  things,  as  Eve  desired  the 
fruit  of  the  forbidden  tree,  Gen.  iii.  6.  (b)  To  indifferent  and  law- 
Vol.  ii.  2  X 


378        THE  TENTH  COMMANDMENT  EXPLAINED. 

fill  things,  but  too  immoderately  and  insatiably  ;  men  will  have  for 
instance  too  great  a  desire  to  eating  and  drinking,  like  "  the  riotous- 
eaters  of  flesh,  and  the  wine-bibbers,"  of  whom  Solomon  speaks, 
Piov.  xxiii  20  ;  too  immoderate  a  desire  to  marry,  like  Shechem, 
the  son  of  Hamor,  Gen.  xxxv.  ii — 19  ;  an  impatient  desire  for  chil- 
dren, like  Rachel,  Gen.  xxx.  1  ;  and  an  insatiable  love  of  money,  a 
desire  to  be  rich,  1  Tim.  vi.  9,  10.  (c)  From  these  evil  roots  pro- 
ceeds also  a  desire  to  good  and  divine  things  with  an  evil  end,  that 
We  may  obtain  a  name,  and  get  gain  by  them,  as  Simon  the  sor- 
cerer desired  the  gifts  of  the  Spirit,  Acts  viii.  18,  19.  See  also 
Janus  iv.   13. 

These  evil  branches  bring  forth  also  many  evil  fruits.  They  are 
the  causes  of  all  other  sins  :  "  Every  man,"  saith  James,  "  is  drawn 
away  of  his  own  lust,  and  enticed  i  hen  when  lust  hath  conceived, 
it  bringelh  foitli  sin,"  James  i.  14,  15.  1  will  mention  a  few  of 
these  bitter  fruits,  as  (a)  sinful  thoughts,  which  muse  too  long  or 
unseasonably  upon  visible  things ;  to  which  also  belongs  forming 
chimerical  schemes  or  plans  ;  for  instance,  the  fool  thinks  through 
his  covetousness,  If  1  were  but  so  wise,  or  so  rich,  or  had  such  an 
office,  then  I  would  do  this  or  that.  Or  a  person  muses  upon  sinful 
and  abominable  things,  sometimes  waking  and  sometimes  also  sleep- 
ing, suffering  "  vain  thoughts  to  lodge  within  him,"  as  the  prophet 
compkiins,  Jer.  iv.  14.  (b)  Opposing,  suppressing,  and  stifling  the 
good  mo  ions,  which  the  Holy  Spirit  excites  m  the  conscience,  that 
the  sinner  may  oppose  his  covetousness,  but  he  "quenches  the  Spi- 
rit," contrary  to  the  admonition  of  Paul,  1  Thess.  v.  19,  and  "his 
flesh  lusteth  against  the  Spirit,"  as  the  same  apostle  speaks  Gal.  v. 
17.  And  because  he  cannot  satisfy  his  lust,  by  obeying  the  Loid, 
therefore  he  resists  the  Lord  ;  for  u  the  carnal  mind  is  enmity  against 
God  :  for  it  is  not  subject  to  the  law  of  God,  neither  indeed  can  be," 
according  to  Kom.  viii.  7.  (cj  Utithankfulrtcsa  ;  doih  God  bestow 
good  things  upon  him,  he  is  not  thankful,  because  he  dotes  upon 
tiie  good  things  of  others  ;  he  murmurs  and  frets  against  the  Lord, 
because  he  may  not  have  that  which  belongeth  to  his  neighbour  : 
"These,"  saith  Jude  in  his  epistle,  vs.  16,  "are  murmurers,  com- 
plainer$,  walking  after  their  own  lusts"  (d)  It  is  also  an  evil  fruit 
of  covetousness,  that  men  are  Urged  by  it  10  grudging  and  to  other 
sordid  vices,  because  they  may  not  have  what  another  hath;  for 
"  the  works  of  the  flesh  are"  not  only  "  lasciviousness  and  idolatry," 
but  also  "  witchcraft,  hatred,  variance,  emulation,  wrath,  strife,  sedi- 
tions, envyings,  murders,"  as  the  aposde  speaks,  Gal    v.  19 — 21. 

Rut  this  covetousness  doth  hot  arrive  to  its  full  height  and  strength 
at  once,  but  grows  grauuuily. 


XLIV.  LORD'S  DAY.  Q.  1 1 3—1  is.  T9 

1.  Covetousness  is  a  habit,  and  that  foul  source,  or  inherent  cri- 
minal sin,  from  which  every  active  desire  that  is  sinful  proceeds. 
The  reason  why  ';  the  -wickedness  of  Mali  is  great  in  the  earth  i?, 
that  the  invagination  of  the  thoughts  of  his  heart  is  only  evi!  con- 
tinually," as  die  Lord  saith,  Gen.  vi.  5.  M  For  otrt  o!  ■!  ■•  he  iM  pro- 
ceed evil  thoughts,"  &c.  Matt.  xv.  19,  and  "as  a  fountain  casteth 
out  her  waters,  so  "  the  heart  "  casteth  out  its  wlc&ednessy'  Jer. 
vi.  7.  This  habitual  covetousness  is  called  by  Paul,  Rom.  vii.  17, 
18,  23,  26, "  indwelling  sin j  the  flesh,  the  law  of  sin."  That  this 
habitual  covetousness  is  also  forbidden  here  is  evident;  for  "the 
efi& of  the  commandmenl  is  charity,  out  of  a  pure  heart,"  1  Tim. 
i.  5,  and  the  law    w.  given  to  mankind,  when  they  were  perfect. 

2.  From  this  proceeds  that  first  ebullition  and  notion,  which  pro- 
vokes to  sin,  while  it  is  not  approved,  or  followed  with  a  contrivance 
to  execute  it,  yea,  is  even  resisted  and  suppressed.  The  Papists,  So- 
cinians  and  Remonstrants  deny  that  these  first  motions  of  lust  are 
sins  and  forbidden,  not  only  because  they  do  not  acknowledge  origin- 
al righteousness,  but  also  because  they  must  in  this  manner  defend 
their  vainglorious  freewill,  and  the  perfection  of  the  saints  ;  for  the^- 
see  inJeed  that  they  cannot  prevent  these  ebullitions.  But  that  theste 
first  motions  are  forbidden  is  evident,  (a)  from  this  tenth  command- 
ment, which  doth  not  limit,  but  forbiddeth  all  covetousness.  (b)  Paul 
saith,  Rom.  vii.  7,  "  I  had  not  known  lust  to  be  sin,  except  the  law 
had  said,  Thou  shalt  not  covet."  Did  not  he,  who  was  brought  urv 
at  the  feet  of  Gamaliel,  know  before  his  conversion,  that  lust  to  whiclh 
we  assent,  and  which  we  contrive  how  to  execute,  was  sin  ?  Eveu 
the  heatiiens  could  know  this.  He  speaks  then  of  those  emotions  , 
that  rise  first  of  al*.  (c)  This  covetousness  militates  against  perfec  t 
love,  and  against  the  Spirit,  according  to  Matt.  xxii.  37 — 40.  Gal 
v.  17.  (d)  according  to  the  words  of  James,  "  a  man  is  drawn> 
away  and  enticed  by  his  own  lust,  upon  which'  lust  conr.eiveth  and 
bringeth  forth  sin,"  James  i.  14,15.  What  lust  must  we  under- 
stand here,  by  that  which  draws  away,  entices  and  conaeives  but  that 
first  ebullition  which  draws  away,  entices  and  conceives  by  the  pleas- 
ure that  it  takes  in  sin,  and  in  contriving  to  execute  it  ?  It  is  true, 
this  lust  is  distinguished  from  the  sin  that  it  conceives  and  brings 
forth  ;  yet  not  in  order  to  deny  its  sinfulness,  but  to  distinguish  a 
less  from  a  greater  sin,  and  to  shew  how  a  less  sin  brings  forth  a 
greater,  as  Paul  also  saith,  that  "sin,  taking  occasion  by  the  com- 
mandment, wrought  in  him  all  manner  of  concupiscence,"  Rom.  vii. 
S.  That  which  brings  forth  sin  is  surely  sin  ;  for  like  brings  forth 
like. 

3.  From  this  foul  source,  and   from  these  sinful  ebullitions  pro- 
ceeds also  that  assent   to   lust,  by  which  we   take  a  pleasure  in  it, 


380        THE  TENTH  COMMANDMENT  EXPLAINED, 

muse  on  it  with  delight,  cherish  it,  and  suffer  ourselves  to  be  urged 
to  fulfil  it,  when  we  have  an  opportunity,  and  are  able  :  and  in  this 
manner  doth  "  lust  conceive  and  bring  forth  sin,"  James  i.   15. 

2.  When  God  forbids  a  sin,  he  then  also  commands  the  contrary 
virtue  ;  for  we  cannot  avoid  sin  except  by  pursuing  virtue,  and  there- 
fore God  commands  here, 

'  1 .  Regeneration  after  the  image  of  God,  inasmuch  as  this  restrains 
and  subdueth  the  strength  of  sinful  concupiscence.  Therefore  the 
prophet  saith,  "  Circumcise  yourselves  to  the  Lord,  and  take  away 
the  foreskins  of  your  heart,"  Jer.  iv.  4.  We  "  cast  away  our  trans- 
gressions by  making  ourselves  a  new  heart  and  a  new  spirit,"  as  we 
read,  Ezek.  xviii.  31. 

2.  Satisfaction  in  God,  whereby  all  our  desires,  being  filled  with 
him;  are  listless  towards  sin  :  "  Whom  have  I  in  heaven  but  thee  ? 
and  there  is  none  upon  earth  that  I  desire  besides  thee,"  saith 
Asaph  to  the  Lord,  Psalm  lxxiii.  25.  So  llabakkuk  also  expresseth 
himself  in  his  prophecy,  ch.  iii    17,   18. 

3.  Contentment  with  that  portion  of  earthly  goods,  which  God 
bestows  on  us.  Paul  "  having  learned  in  whatsoever  state  he  was, 
•therewith  to  he  content,"  Philip,  iv.  11,  exhorts  others  also  "  to  be 
content  with  such  things  as  they  have,"  Heb.  xiii.  5. 

'4,  Joy  and  pleasure  in  our  neighbour's  welfare,  so  that'  we  "  re- 
joice with  them  who  do  rejoice,"  Rom.  xii.    15. 

5.  Hatred  and  opposition  to  all  that  is  sinful,  by  which  we  en- 
.deavour  to  subdue  and  mortify  all  our  lusts,  according  to  the  admo- 
nition of  the  apostle,  Col.  iii.  5,  for  thus  "  we  abstain  from  fleshly 
lusts,  which  war  against  the  soul,"  as  Peter  requireth,  1  Peter  ii.  11. 

6.  An  insatiable  desire,  and  active  inclination  to  all  righteousness, 
-by  which,  with  David  and  Paul,  "  we  delight  in  the  law  and  com- 
mandments of  God,  afteV  the  inner  man,"  Psalm  cxix.  47,  131. 
Rom.  vii.  22. 

3.  The  sinful  heart  will  not  submit  to  such  a  restraint,  it  imagines 
that  this  would  be  unreasonable.  But  this  "  commandment  is  holy, 
just  and  good,"  as  Paul  said  of  it,  when  he  saw  himself  condemned 
by  it,  Rom.  vii.  12.  For  (a)  covetousness  militates  against  the  sove- 
reignty of  God  over  the  heart.  Therefore  he  also  mark*  it  strictly, 
»nd  will  judge  it,  according  to  Jer.  xvii.  9,  10.  Rom.  ii.  16,  and 
f-quires  that  the  pet  son,  who  is  in  covenant  with  him,  should  be 
,  as  the  Lord  his  God  is  holy,  Lev.  xix.  2.  We  must  there- 
fore "  put  off  the  old  man,  which  is  corrupt  according  to  the  deceit- 
ful lusts  :  and  be  renewed  in  the  spirit  of  our  minds;  and  put  on 
the  new  man,  which  after  God  is  created  in   righteousness  and  true

holiness,"  Eph,  iv.  22 — 24  Yea,  covetousness  militates  also  against 
the  providence  of  God,  who  gives  to  every  man  as  much  as  he  plea- 
seth.  Therefore  when  God  bestows  any  good  thing  upon  our 
neighbour,  and  withholds  it  from  us,  "  shall  our  eye  be  evil,  because 
God  is  good,"  as  the  Saviour  asks,  disapproving  of  such  a  temper, 
Malt.  xx.  15.  (b)  It  is  also  vaniiy  to  be  so  intent  upon  earthly 
matteis  ;  for  it  is  vain  to  rise  up  early,  to  sit  up  late,  and  to  eat  the 
bread  of  sorrow  :  for  so  he  giveth  his  beloved  sleep,"  Psalm  cxxvii. 
2.  Neither  can  the  capacious  soul  be  satisfied  with  all  these  visible 
things  ;  the  round  world  cannot  fill  the  triangular  heart :  "  The  eye 
is  not  satisfied  with  seeing,  nor  the  ear  filled  with  hearing,"  saith 
the  wise  king,  Eccl.  i.  8.  God  alone  is  able  to  fill  the  rational  soul, 
and  to  afford  her  a  satisfying  pleasure  with  his  allsufficiency.  See 
2  Cor.  ix.  8. 

II  We  have  thus  explained  the  whole  law :  but  we  do  still  not 
understand  it,  if  we  do  not  rightly  comprehend  the  end,  for  which 
the  law  was  given.  To  what  purpose  then  is  the  law  ?  To  teach 
us  that  man  can  keep  it  perfectly,  after  it  is  once  become  weak 
through  the  flesh  I  Paul  denies  this,  when  he  saith,  Gal.  iii.  21, 
11  If  there  had  been  a  law  given,  which  could  have  given  life,  verily 
righteousness  should  have  been  by  the  law."  To  explain  this  more 
particularly,  we  will,  with  the  instructor,  inquire,  (1)  whether  those 
who  are  converted  to  God  can  keep  the  law  perfectly,  and  if  not,  (2) 
why  God  suffers  it  to  be  preached  to  us  so  strictly. 

We  presuppose  that  man,  before  the  fall  was  both  obliged,  and 
able  to  keep  the  law,  in  order  to  obtain  life  by  his  own  righteous- 
ness ;  that  since  the  fall,  and  since  the  upraising  of  the  elect  sinner, 
man  is  still  obliged  to  keep  the  law  perfectly  ;  for  he  should  other- 
wise not  sin  any  more  :  neither  can  he  ever  be  discharged  from  a 
perfect  obligation  to  the  Supreme  Ruler,  because  as  long  as  he  is 
a  creature,  and  the  Lord  is  God,  so  long  he  is  in  every  respect  sub- 
ject to  God.  We  maintain  also  that  the  sinner,  while  in  the  state  of 
nature,  is  wholly  unable  to  do  aught  that  is  good,  as  we  have  shown 
on  the  eighth  and  ninth  questions.  But  the  subject  of  our  present 
inquiry  is,  whether  those  who  are  converted  to  God  can  keep  the 
law  perfectly.  We  allow  that  believers  possess,  in  consequence  of 
their  new  birth,  a  certain  ability  for  that  which  is  good.  We  also 
acknowledge  that  they  possess  a  certain  perfection,  not  only  with  re- 
spect to  justification,  by  which  <l  they  are  perfect  in  Christ,"  as 
Paul  saith,  Col.  ii.  10,  but  also  with  respect  to  sanctification,  even  a 
perfection  of  sincerity,  and  of  parts,  of  soul  and  body,  a  perfect  heart 
and  "  a  sincere  resolution  to  live,  not  only  according  to  some,  but

according  to  all  the  commands  of  God,"  as  David  and  Hezekiah  tes- 
tify concerning   themselves,    Psalm  cxix.   128.     Isaiah  xxxviii.  3. 
Moreover,  one  believer  is  said  to    be  more  perfect   than  another,  on 
account  of  his  greater  proficiency  :  "  Strong   meat     belongeth    to 
them  who  are  perfect,"*  Heb.  v.   14.     But  the  question  is,  whether 
a  believer  can  in  this  present  life  be  perfect,  with  respect  to  degrees, 
and  thus  be  wholly  sinless.     This  is  the  doctrine  of  the  Papists,  So- 
cinians  and  Remonstrants.     They  cannot  otherwise  maintain   the 
doctrine  of  their  indifferent  freewill.     Yea,  the  Papists  conceive  that 
they  can  be  more  than   perfect  by  their  works  of  supererogation  : 
and  the  Socinians  think  that  tney  can  be  more  perfect  than  the  law 
of  Moses  required,  because  they  must  now  live  according  to  the  im- 
proved law  of  Christ ;  but  we  deny  such  a  perfection   of  the   saints. 
It  those  persons,  who  boast  so  much  of  their  perfection,    knew    the 
unspotted  holiness  of   God,  and  the   spirituality  of  the  law,  and   if 
they  were  only  experimentally  convinced  with  Paul  by  the  tenth  com- 
mandment, "  that  lust  is  sin,"  they  would  assent  to   the   doctrine, 
that  the  saints  cannot  be  perfect  in  this  life.     They   ought   at    least 
to  have    learned    better   from    the    word    of  God :    for  that  saith, 
(I)  That  all  men,  and   therefore  those   also,  who   are  converted    to 
God,  have  sins  :  "  There  is  no    man  who    sinneth   not,"  saith    wise 
Solomon,  1  Kings  viii.  46.     Prov   xx.  9.     Eccl.  vii.  20.   "  In  many 
things  we  offend  all,"  saith  James  in  his    epistle,  chap.  iii.  2,   and 
John  saith,  "  If  we  say  that   we   have  no  sin.  we   deceive  ourselves, 
and  the  truth  is  net  in  us,"    1  John  i.  8.      The    most   holy    persons 
also  acknowledge,  that  they   are  guilty  of  sin  ;  see  this  in  that  most 
upright  man   Job.  chap.  ix.  2,  3 — in  the  man  after  God's  own  heart, 
Psalm  xix.  12.     exxx.  3.     cxliii.  2,  and  in  that  highly   enlightened 
apostle,  Philip,  iii.  12.     (2)  "  The  holiest  men   have  but   small  be- 
ginnings of  this  perfect  obedience."     Paul   and   other    great   saints 
"  knew  and  prophesied   but   in  part,"   1  Cor.  xiii.  9,  10.       He   and 
the  holy  Romans    bad   only  "the    first-fruits  of  the   Spirit,"  Rom. 
■viii.  23.     Now  we  know  what  a  small  beginning  of  the    harvest  the 
first-fruits  are.     (3)  The   most  that  the  saints   have  is,  that  "with  a 
sincere  resolution  they  begin  to  live  not  only  according  to  some,  but 
according  to  all  the  commandments  of  God."     See  David's  longing 
Psalm  cxix.  5,  and    Paul's  panting  after  perfection,    Philip,   iii.   12, 
15.     "  To  will  is  present  with  me,  but  how  to  perform  that  which  is 
good,  I  find  not,"  Rom.  vii.  18.     And  what    hindereth    them  from 
being  perfect  in/tins  life  ?  is  it  not  their  remaining  corruptions   and 

•  This  is  aj-reeablc  to  the  Dutch  translation. 


XLIV.  LORD'S  DAY".  Q.   113—115.  333 

iusis,  that  "when  they  would  do  good,  evil  is  present  with  them, 
and  they  are  brought  into  captivity  to  the  law  of  sin,  which  is  in  their 
members,"  Rom.  vii.  21,  23.  See  how  the  same  Paul  speaks,  GaL 
v.   17. 

When  it  is  said,  that  the  most  holy  persons,  who  have  made  a 
greater  proficiency  than  others,  "  have  only  small  beginnings  of 
obedience  to  God,"  it  cloth  not  follow  therelrom,  that  those  who  are 
least  holy,  and  are  nevertheless  truly  converted,  have  nothing  at  all  of 
this  obedience ;  for  the  most  holy,  when  they  are  compared  with 
the  perfect  demand  of  God's  law,  and  the  state  of  perfection  after 
this  life,  cannot  have  more  than  such  small  beginnings  ;  but  if  we 
compare  them  with  those,  who  have  made  the  least  proficiency,  then 
they  are,  as  it  were,  perfect,  and  those  least  holy  persons  are  like 
children,  who  are  yet  busy  with  first  principles,  according  to  Jtleb* 
v.  12—  14. 

We  read  indeed  often  of  the  saints,  that  "  they  walk  with  a  per- 
fect heart  in  all  the  commandments  of  the  Lord  blameless,"  as  it  is 
said  of  David,  1  Kings  ix.  4.  xiv  8.  Acts  xiii.  22,  and  of  Heze- 
kiah,  2  Kings  xviii  6,  and  of  Zacharias,  Luke  i.  6.  But  the  sins 
of  those  saints  are  too  well  known  that  we  should  conclude  there- 
from, that  they  had  attained  to  a  perfection  of  degrees.  These 
phrases  only  intimate  that  they  possessed  a  perfection  of  parts,  which 
doth  not  exclude  their  stumblings.  Though  "  Asa  took  not  away 
the  high  places,  and  was  guilty  of  other  sins,  nevertheless  the  heart 
of  Asa  was  perfect  all  his  days,"  2  Chron.  xv.  17.     xvi.  2 — 12. 

"  Why  then  will  God  have  the  ten  commandments  so  strictly 
preached,  since  no  man  in  this  life  can  keep  them  *"  Thus  asks 
the  instructor  from  the  mouth  of  our  adversaries,  who  assert  that 
the  strict  preaching  of  the  law  is  an  evidence,  that  we  can  keep  it 
perfectly.  Before  we  remove  this  difficulty,  we  say  that  the  strict 
pieaching  of  the  law  doth  not  consist  in  urging  it  as  the  condition 
of  the  covenant  of  works,  that  we  may  seek  life  by  it,  or  as  a  spe- 
cial ministration  of  the  Old  Testament  ;  for  in  this  respect  believ- 
ers are  "  no  longer  under  the  law,"  Rom.  vi.  14.  Gal  iii.  25,  and 
in  this  respect  Christ  hath  fulfilled  it  for  them,  Rom.  viii.  3,  4,  but 
in  seriously  exhibiting  it,  as  an  everlasting  rule  of  obedience,  in  all 
its  extent,  obligations,  threatenings  and  promises.  We  may  not 
preach  the  law  thus,  say  the  Antinomians.  But  Christ  and  his 
apostles  preached  it  in  this  strict  manner.  Paul  requires  that  Titus 
should  "rebuke  sharply  and  with  all  authority,"  Titus  i.  13.  ii.  15. 
We  are,  and  always  will  remain  obligated  to  obey  God,  on  account 
of  his  sovereignty,  and  this  everlasting  obligation  is  rendered   still 


884        THE  TENTH  COMMANDMENT  EXPLAINED. 

Stronger  by  grace  :  "Christ,"  saith  the  apostle,  Titus  ii.  14,  "gave 
himself  for  us,  that  he  might  redeem  us  from  all  iniquity,  and  pu- 
rify unto  himself  a  peculiar  people,  zealous  of  good  works."  Ought 
not  this  obligation  then  to  be  urged,  and  therefore  strictly  preached  ? 
But  if  the  law  must  be  preached  so  strictly,  we  must  then  be 
able  to  keep  it  perfectly,  otherwise  it  will  be  in  vain  to  preach  it  so 
strictly,  say  the  patrons  of  the  perfection  of  the  saints.  But  no  duty 
declares  what  we  can,  but  what  we  ought  to  do,  as  we  have  shown 
upon  the  eighth  and  ninth  question.  And  though  God  doth  not 
require  that  the  law  should  be  preached  strictly,  because  we  can 
keep  it,  yet  there  are  other  reasons  for  this.  It  is  proper  to  preach 
it  strictly,  in  order  to  condemn  and  restrain  the  reprobates  ;  "  for 
whose  sake  the  law  was  given,"  according  to  1  Tim.  i.  9,  10,  and  to 
convince  the  elect  before  they  are  converted  in  order  to  their  conver- 
sion, and  to  urge  them  to  the  Mediator,  Rom.  iii.  20.  x.  4.  But  besides 
this,  the  strict  preachingof  the  law  is  serviceable  to  believers,  (a)  "  That 
all  their  lifetime  they  may  learn  more  and  more  to  know  their  sinful 
nature."  For  they  are  by  this  mean  humbled,  and  rendered  capable  of 
more  grace,  as  the  heart  of  Josiah  became  "  tender,"  when  the  law  was 
read  to  him,  2  Kings  xxti.  11—22.  (b) "  That  they  may  thus  be- 
come the  more  earnest  in  seeking  the  remission  of  sins,  and  righ- 
teousness in  Christ."  For  the  law  teafcfteth  them  the  necessity  of 
remission,  anJ  the  gospel  revealing  Christ  to  them,  they  are  urged 
to  him.  Paul,  convinced  of  his  condition  by  the  law,  cried  out  for 
deliverance  through  Christ,  Rem.  vii.  24.  D  •  d  did  this  before 
him,  Psalm  xxxii,  li.  (c)  "  That  they  may  constantly  endeavour 
and  pray  to  God  for  his  grace,"  &c.  The  law,  when  it  is  preached 
strictly,  exhibits  perfect  holiness  in  all  its  lustre,  and  believers  being 
in  consequence  of  this,  smitten  with  the  love  of  it,  "  press  after  per- 
fection," with  Paul,  Philip,  iii.  12,  13,  and  pray  earnestly  for  the 
grace  of  God,  that  he  would  cause  thertl  to  keep  his  law.  Hear 
what  the  great  lover  of  the  law  saith  to  the  Lord.  Psalm  cxix.  4,  5. 
"  Thou  hast  commanded  me  to  keep  thy  precepts  diligently.  O 
that  my  ways  were  directed  to  keep  thy  statutes."  We  might  as- 
sign other  reasons  for  preaching  the  law  strictly  to  believers,  as,  that 
they  may  thus  see  what  Chvis*.  hath  done  for  them  ;  that  the  law 
is  a  rule  of  thankfulness  to  them,  who  are  God's  covenant  peoples 
and  that  the  law  is  to  them  an  evidence  of  the  grace  of  God,  since' 
they  have  the  law  in  their  hearts,  and  they  delight  in  it,  and  observ? 
it:  but  we  may  not  insist  too  long  on  these  thing 


XLIV.  LORD'S  DAY.  Q.  113—115.  385 


APPLICATION. 

So  long,  hearers,  have  ye  heard  the  strict  preaching  of  the  law. 
But  hath  it  answered  these  good  purposes  with  you  ?  burely  many 
of  you  have  not  yet  been  properly  advantaged  by  it.  It  is  evi- 
dent ;  for 

1.  The  most  of  you  know  not  yet  their  sinful  nature.  Some 
know  indeed  that  they  have  sinned  ;  but  do  ye  indeed  see  that  your 
very  nature  is  sinful,  that  ye  are  thoroughly  leavened  with  sin,  and 
that  it  is  become,  as  it  were,  your  second  nature  to  sin  ?  no,  ye  do 
not  know  your  sinful  lusting  ;  ye  think  that  if  ye  do  not  render 
yourselves  guilty  of  gross  sins,  ye  are  already  very  virtuous  ;  ye 
know  not  with  an  inward,  experimental  knowledge,  that  lust  is  sinful 
in  you,  although  the  law  saith,  "  Thou  shalt  not  covet,"  and  ye 
dare  think,  yea,  even  say,  that  ye  are  not  covetous,  but  content  with 
your  own.  Why  should  we  wonder,  for  ye  never  come  to  your- 
selves, and  do  not  look  to  the  bottom  of  your  corrupt  hearts,  and 
thus  "  do  not  know  the  plague  of  your  hearts,"  as  is  required,  1 
Kings  viii.  38. 

2.  Many  sin  and  are  careless,  from  an  observation  of  the  imper- 
fections of  the  saints.  What  thinkest  thou,  O  sinner,  when  thy 
lust  enticeth  thee  to  this  and  that  sin,  dost  thou  not  then  venture  to 
commit  it,  because  the  saints  defiled  themselves  with  such  sins  ? 
and  when  thy  conscience  reproves  thee  on  account  of  thine  abomi- 
nations, dost  thou  not  then  flatter  thyself  that,  since  the  saints  obtain- 
ed the  forgiveness  of  their  sins,  thou  also  wilt  obtain  forgiveness  ? 
but  do  thy  sins  distress  thee  as  much  as  the  sins  of  the  saints  dis- 
tressed them  ?  and  cio  they  cause  thee  to  seek  with  such  earnestness, 
forgiveness  and  righteousness  in  Christ,  and  to  fight  and  guard  more 
earnestly  through  the  grace  of  the  Lord  against  sin,  as  the  sins  of 
the  saints  constrained  them  to  do  ?  See  this  in  David  and  Josiah, 
Psalm  li.  2  Chron.  xxxiv.  19 — 27.  And  it  is  still  baser,  that  many 
of  you  watch  for  the  failings  of  the  saints,  in  order  to  scoff  at  them, 
and  to  reproach  them  on  account  of  their  failings,  with  much  sar- 
castic bitterness,  both  in  their  presence  and  absence  :  "  men  watch 
for  their  halting,"  as  the  prophet  complains,  Jer.  xx.  10,  "  and 
when  they  halt,  rejoice,"  as  David  experienced  to  his  sorrow,  Psalm 
xxxv.  15.  But  if  ye  knew  their  distress  on  account  of  their  hailing, 
ye  would  not  add  to  their  sorrow.  David  had  therefore  reason  to 
say  to  the  Lord,  Psalm  xxxviii.  16,  17.  "Lest  they  should  rejoice 
over  me  :  when  my  foot  slippeth,  they  magnify  themselves  against 

Vol.  ii.  2  Y

me.  For  I  am  ready  to  halt,  and  my  sorrow  is  continually  be- 
fore me." 

3.  There  are  few  who  make  a  right  use  of  the  preaching  of  the 
law  ;  for  some  cannot  and  will  not  hear  the  strict  preaching  of  the 
law,  they  cannot  endure  that  probing  of  their  hearts,  and  it  provokes 
them  to  indignation  against  the  preacher  of  the  law.  Is  it  not  tiue  ? 
will  ye  not  hate  him,  speak  evil  of  him,  depart  from  him,  and 
turn  away  your  ears,  while  he  preaches,  from  hearing  the  law  ?  The 
surly  temper  of  God's  ancient  people  prevails  also  in  many  of  you. 
See  this  wickedness  detected  and  threatened,  Isaiah  xxx.  9 — 14. 
lix.  Amos  v.  10.  Others  are  better  pleased  with  the  preaching  of 
the  law  :  they  hear  willingly  a  wise  reprover,  and  even  say  that  he 
cannot  preach  too  sharply  ;  but  they  do  not  proceed  any  further. 
Some  of  you  are  indeed  at  times  alarmed,  and  are  afraid  with  Felix  ; 
but  ye  seek  to  divert  it,  as  he  did,  Acts  xxiv.  25,  or  are  with 
"  Agrippa  almost  persuaded  to  become  Christians,"  Acts  xxvi.  28, 
but  this  is  all  that  comes  of  it  ;  and  If  it  produce  any  effect,  it  will 
not  induce  you  to  seek  with  restlessness,  pardon  and  righteousness 
in  Christ ;  this  ye  neglect ;  but  endeavour  to  amend  in  some  meas- 
ure your  evil  doings ;  and  when  ye  advance  a  little  therein,  ye 
think  that  God  will  overlook  all  your  shortcomings,  as  weaknesses  : 
and  ye  have  thus,  like  the  Jews,  "  a  zeal  for  God  ;  but  not  according 
to  knowledge  :  for  ye  are  ignorant  of  God's  righteousness,  and  go 
about  to  establish  your  own  righteousness  ;  and  do  not  thus  submit 
yourselves  to  the  righteousness  of  God,"  Rom.  x.  2,  3.  For  ye 
seek  not  your  salvation  and  rest  in  "Christ,  who  is  the  end  of  the 
law  for  righteousness  to  every  one  that  believeth,"  vs.  4,  but  in  your 
own  doings. 

Therefore  all  that  ye  have  heard  so  long  a  time,  of  the  law,  hath 
been  unprofitable,  and  of  no  service  tojou.  And  consequently  the 
whole  law,  with  ail  its  commands  and  threatenings,  is  yet  against 
you,  and  ye  lie  under  the  ciKse  of  the  law,  which  is  denounced 
against  the  transgressors,  Gal.'iii.  10,  12,  and  ye  never  will,  while 
yc  remain  in  your  present  condition,  surmount  it ;  "  for  God  will 
by  no  means  clear  the  gu  ity."  Exod.  xxxiv.  7,  and  ye  arc  guilty 
before  him.  Will  ye  flee  bom  the  wrath  to  come,  flee  then  to  the 
Son  of  God,  in  order  to  obt  tin  in  him  grace  and  mercy  of  the  Lord ; 
«  for  Christ  is  the  end  of  the  law  lb.-  righteousness  to  every  one  that 
believeth/'  Rom.  x 

But  ye,  O  bel  vers  nrtist  also  still  make  use  of  the  law,  though 
yea'-e  not  any  longer  under  the  law,  but  under  grace,  and  the  right- 
eousness of  U*e  law   is  i'uifuUu   ui   yuu  tlnough  the  satisfaction  of 


XLIV.  LORD'S  DAY.  Q.  1 1C — \15.  387 

Christ ;    for   the   law  must   yet   be   strictly   preached  to  you  also. 
Tli  ere  fore, 

1.  Exercise  yourselves  yet  daily  in  seeking  a  knowledge  of  your 
sins,  that  ye  may  become  more  and  more  acquainted  with  your  sin- 
ful nature.  When  God  began  to  lay  his  good  hand  on  you,  in  order 
to  convert  you,  he  discovered  to  you  indeed  your  abominableness 
and  guilt,  yet  he  discovered  it  only  in  part  ;  but  now  ye  must  behold 
still  greater  abominations.  Therefore  examine  yourselves  olten  by 
the  law,  and  compare  yourselves  with  all  that  is  commanded  and 
forbidden  in  it ;  give  strict  heed  to  your  heart,  and  observe  what  en- 
ters in,  and  what  goeth  out  of  it,  and  whither  it  would  mislead  you, 
if  the  Lord  did  not  restrain  you  by  his  grace,  yea,  how  often  it  actu- 
ally seduces  you,  against  your  sine,  re  and  determined  resolution, 
Descend  often  into  yourselves,  that  ye  may  see  that  filthy  bottom, 
and  your  concupiscence,  as  the  first  headspring  of  your  sinful  nature, 
and  how  that  sinful  nature  becomes  active,  when  the  hatefulness  of 
sin  is  exhibited  by  a  prohibition  of  it.  Paul  learned  to  know  his  sin- 
ful nature  in  this  manner  ;  for  he  saith,  Rom.  vii.  8  11,13.  u  Sin, 
taking  occasion  by  the  commandment,  wrought  in  me  all  manner  of 
concupiscence,  deceived  me,  and  by  it  slew  me.  Was  then  that 
■Which  is  good  made  death  unto  me  ?  God  forbid.  But  sin  was  made 
death  to  me,  that  it  might  appear  sin,  working  death  in  me  by  that 
which  is  good ;  that  sin  by  the  commandment  might  become  ex- 
ceeding sinful." 

2.  Beware  that  your  sight  of  your  sinful  nature,  and  your  sorrow 
for  it  do  not  render  you  impatient,  and  fretful  and  that  it  do  not 
discourage  you.  It  hath  pleased  the  Lord  to  lea\e  these  corruptions, 
as  thorns  in  your  eyes,  and  as  goads  in  your  sides,  in  order  to  hum- 
ble you,  that  ye  may  not  be  exalted  on  account  of  the  excellency  of 
the  revelation  ;  that  Christ  may  remain  precious  to  you,  and  that  he 
may  induce  you  to  seek  his  righteousness  continually  ;  and  also  that 
he  may  cause  you  to  be  to  the  glory  of  his  wisdom,  power  and  good- 
ness, since  he  is  able  to  lead  you  in  such  a  sinful  way  to  salvation. 
He  chooses  to  render  you  earnestly  desirous  of  th«  perfect  state  in 
heaven  ;  also  to  retain  you  in  a  state  of  warfare,  that  he  may  render 
you  conquerors,  and  may  crown  you  after  your  work  is  finished. 
Exercise  yourselves  then  in  these  things,  and  continue  engaged  in 
them. 

3.  Beware  of  reproaching  and  despising  others,  who  are  beset 
with  infirmities,  on  account  of  their  stumblings.  Ye  know  how 
your  own  sins  grieve  you  ;  think  not  that  other  godly  persons  take 
pleasure  in  theirs :  "  Brethren,"  saith  the  apostle,  Gal.  vi.  1,  "  if  a

man  be  overtaken  in  a  fault,  ye  which  are  spiritual,  restore  such  an 
one  in  the  spirit  of  meekness  j  considering  thyself,  lest  thou  also 
be  tempted." 

4.  Pursue  after  perfection,  though  ye  cannot  be  perfect.  To  in- 
dulge without  restraint  in  sin,  or  to  be  discouraged,  because  we  can- 
not attain  to  perfection  is  not  the  conduct  of  tender  Christians  ;  for 
they  rather  "reach  forth  to  it,"  with  Paul,  Philip  iii.  12 — u.  If 
we  will  be  in  earnest,  we  will  attain  to  perfection  after  this  life,  yea, 
in  this  life  we  may  always  become  more  perfect  than  we  are. 

5.  Every  believer  should  endeavour  to  labour  and  advance  accord- 
ing  to  his  proficiency.  As  the  man  is,  so  is  his  strength.  A  child, 
a  youth,  and  a  man  in  Christ  must  each  conduct  according  to,  and 
not  above  his  strength,  that  he  may  not  overtoil  himself.  This  the 
apostle  requireth,   Philip,  iii.  15,  16. 

Thus  the  law  will  not  be  a  terror  to  ycu  :  "  The  law  is  not  against 
such  persons,  and  it  was  not  made  fur  righteous  persons,"  as  the 
apostle  saith,  Gal.  v.  23.  1  Tim.  i.  9.  Your  endeavours  and  imper- 
fect obedience,  O  believers,  will  still  be  acceptable  to  God  :  "  For 
if  there  be  first  a  willing  mind,  it  is  accepted,  according  to  that  a 
man  hath,  and  not  according  to  that  he  hath  not,"  saith  Paul,  2 
Cor.  viii  12.  Having  such  a  perfect  heart,  ye  will  be  imboldened  to 
say  with  Heztkiah  to  the  Lord  in  the  hour  of  death,  "  Remember 
now.  O  Lord,  I  beseech  thee,  how  I  have  walked  before  thee  in 
truth,  and  with  a  perfect  heart,  and  have  done  that  which  is  good  in 
thy  sight,"  Isaiah  xxxviii.  3.  It  is  true,  your  lusts  and  imperfec- 
tions do  still  afflict  you,  but  they  will  soon  be  abolished,  and  your 
Head  and  Husband  Christ,  "  will  present  you  to  himself  a  glorious 
church,  not  having  spot,  or  wrinkle,  or  any  such  thing ;  but  holy 
and  without  blemish."  Thus  speaks  Paul,  Eph.  v.  27.  "  And  let 
all  the  people  say  Amen,  yea,  Amen,"

THE  WORK 


OF 


CHRISTIAN  PRAYER. 


XLV.  LORD'S  DAY. 


'  Philip,  iv.  6.  Be  careful  for  nothing:  but  in  every  thing  by  prayer 
and  supplication,  with  thanksgiving,  let  your  requests  be  made 
known  unto  God.

Q.  114.  But  can  those  who  are  converted  to  God,  perfectly  kc</> 
these  commands  ? 

A.  No;  but  even  the  holiest  men,  while  in  this  life,  have  only 
small  beginnings  of  this  obedience,  yet  so,  that  with  a  sincere  reso- 
lution, they  begin  to  live,  not  only  according  to  some,  but  all  the 
commands  of  God. 

Q.  115.  Why  will  God  then  have  all  the  commands  so  strictly  preach- 
ed, since  no  man  in  this  life  can  keep  them  ? 


XLIV.  LORDS  DAY.  Q.  113—115.  375 

A.  First,  that  all  our  lifetime,  we  may  learn  more  and  more  to 
know  our  sinful  nature,  and  thus  become  more  earnest  in  seek'i.g 
the  remission  of  sin,  and  righteousness  in  Christ ;  likewise,  that  we 
constantly  endeavour  and  pray  to  God  for  the  grace  of  the  Holy 
Spirit,  that  we  m:y  become  more  and  more  conformable  to  the 
image  of  God,  till  we  arrive  at  the  perfection  proposed  to  us  in  a 
life  to  come. 

'  T 

JL  have  seen  an  end  of  all  perfection  :  but  thy  commandment  is 
exceeding  broad,"  saith  David,  Psalm  cxix.  96  No  visible  things 
are  so  perfect,  that  they  are  eternal  and  incorruptible  ;  "  for  the 
things  which  are  seen  are  temporal,"  2  Cor.  iv.  18,  nor  are  they  so 
perfect  that  they  have  "not  their  Hmits  ;  they  could  otherwise  afford 
human  beings  a  perfect  satisfaction,  and  would  not  be  accompanied 
with  any  sorrow.  Every  man  can  see  that  they  have  their  limits, 
and  might  be  more  perfect.  Although  a  man  should  be  ever  so 
much  enamoured  of  his  prosperity,  he  will  nevertheless  experience 
at  times  an  interruption  of  his  pleasure.  God  alone  is  infinitely 
perfect,  and  since  his  law  is  an  expression  of  his  perfection,  there- 
fore his  commandment  is  also  exceedingly  broad-  He  who  medi- 
tates in  it  day  and  night  will  find  continually  more  and  more  that 
there  are  unfathomable  depths  in  it,  his  delight  in  it  will  not  cease, 
nor  be  interrupted,  but  continually  renewed.  The  sweet  Psalm- 
ist hath  shown  this  in  the  hundred  and  nineteenth  psalm,  his 
heait  scarcely  indites  a  single  verse,  but  in  order  to  express 
his  pleasure  in  the  commands  of  the  Lord  :  for  '*  the  law  of  the 
Lord  is  perfect,  converting  the  soul,  making  wise  the  simple,  and 
rejoicing  the  heart ;"  thus  he  speaks,  Psalm  xix.  7,  3.  A  man  may 
find  all  that  he  must  either  believe  or  do  in  the  law  ;  it  forbids  all 
that  is  sinful ;  yea,  like  the  whole  word,  Heb.  iv.  12,  the  command- 
ment is  "  a  discerner  of  the  thoughts  and  intents  of  the  heart,"  "  The 
law  is  spiritual,"  saith  Paul,  Rom.  vii.  14.  It  extendeth  to  the  in- 
most desires  of  a  man's  spirit,  when  it  saith,  "  Tnou  shalt  not 
covet,"  &c. 

If  the  Lawgiver  had  forbidden  only  murder,  adultery,  stealing,, 
and  bearing  false  witness,  thf  sinner,  who  knows  neither  the  corrup- 
tion of  his  heart,  nor  the  perfect  holiness  of  God,  would  imagine 
that  the  outward  observation  of  these  commands  would  be  sufficient : 
but  the  Lord  prevents  this,  when  he  forbids  in  this  commandment 
also  the  unholiness  and  sinful  desires  of  bis  spirit. 

The  instructor  proposes  here  two  particulars  for  our  consideration  s 


376      THE  TENTH  COMMANDMENT  EXPLAINED, 

I.  The  nature  of  the  tenth  commandment,  Question  113. 

II.  1  he  end  of  the  giving  of  the  law,  Question  114,  115. 

1.  The  Lawgiver  forbids  "coveting  our  neighbour's  house,  wife> 
manservant,  maidservant,  ox,  ass,  and  aught  that  is  our  neighbour's," 
or,  belongs  to  him.  A  certain  proof,  that  this  commandment  re- 
lates to  loving  our  neighbour,  and  so  belongs  to  the  second  table. 
Yet  we  need  not  scruple  to  refer  it  also  to  the  first  table,  with  the 
catechism,  which  saith,  in  order  to  explain  this  commandment, 
"  that  even  the  smallest  inclination  or  thought  contrary  to  any  of 
God's  commandments  should  never  arise  in  our  hearts,"  See.  Paul 
saith,  Rom.  xiii.  10,  "  Love  worketh  no  ill  to  his  neighbour:  there- 
fore love  is  the  fulfilling  of  the  law."  Consequently  the  commands 
of  the  second  table  respect  also  the  commands  of  the  first,  which 
belong  also  to  the  law,  and  are  fulfilled  by  keeping  the  second  tablet 

The  Lawgiver  saith  twice,  "  Thou  Shalt  not  covet,"  once  with 
respect  to  our  neighbour's  house,  and  again  with  respect  to  his  wife. 
Surely  not-  in  order  to  give  us  here  two  distinct  commands,  as  the 
Papists  assert,  which  we  refuted,  when  we  divided  the  law  into  two 
tables,  in  treating  on  the  93d  question  :  but  the  Lord  repeats  the 
word  covet,  in  order  to  teach  us,  that  it  ought  to  be  repeated  before 
every  object,  which  is  exhibited  here,  and  to  manifest  his  earnest- 
ness in  forbidding  covetousness,  that  the  person  who  is  in  covenant 
with  him  may  beware  of  it  the  more.  "  Coveting."  (or  desiring) 
we  know  is  that  active  power  of  the  soul,  which  goeth  forth  with 
delight  and  inclination  to  that,  which  is  represented  by  the  under- 
standing as  good,  whether  it  be  a  real,  or  an  apparent  good  ;  for 
we  cannot  covet  aught  that  is  represented  to  us  as  evil,  but  we  have 
an  aversion  from  it.  When  now  the  Lawgiver  saith,  "  thou  shalt 
not  covet,"  he  speaks  not  then  of  a  natural  desire  to  necessary 
things  ;  for  he  himself  hath  implanted  such  a  desire  in  man  for  his 
wellbeing ;  much  less  doth  he  forbid  a  good  desire  of  his  favour  and 
fellowship,  since  he  commands  this,  Psalm  Ixxxi.  10,  and  will  ful- 
fil it,  Isaiah  Iv.  1,  but  he  forbids  a  sinful  desire. 

This  sinful  desire  (or  coveting)  is  "  the  smallest  inclination  or 
thought,  which  ariseth  in  our  hearts,  contrary  to  any  of  God's  com- 
■mandments,"  according  to  the  explanation  of  the  instructor,  and  it 
is  thus  the  beginning  of  every  sin,  which  is  forbidden  in  the  other 
commandments.  Paul  also  teaches  us  this,  when  he  saith,  that  "  he 
was  convinced  by  this  tenth  commandment  of  all  his  sins,  "  Rom. 
vii.  7,  8.  Thus  also  the  Saviour  teacheth,  that  "  looking  on  a  wo- 
man to  lust  after  her,  is  committing  adultery  with  her  in  our  heart," 
!S\d*.  v.  2;8.      Achan  was  enticed  by  hie   lust  to  steal  of  that  which 


XLIV.  LORD'S  DAY.  Q.  113—115.  377 

had  been  devoted,  Joshua  vii  21.  And  so  this  commandment  serves 
to  explain  the  foregoing-  commandments,  by  teaching  us,  that  God 
forbids  not  only  the  outward  sinful  actions,  but  even  the  desires  of 
the  soul  to  those  sins. 

But  this  commandment  doubtless  forbids  also  that  which  is  not  so 
particularly  intended  in  the  other  commands,  and  that  is  u  discon- 
tentment," whereby  a  person  craves  besides  what  he  hath  himself, 
and  with  which  he  ought  to  be  contented,  also  the  property  of 
another,  although  not  by  unrig'  teous  methods,  and  when  he  cannot 
obtain  it  so,  is  not  satisfied  }  as  Ahab  coveted  the  vineyard  of  Na- 
both,  and  was  willing  to  give  him  a  better  for  it,  or  the  value  of  it 
in  money  ;  but  upon  being  refused,  was  displeased,  1  Kings  xxi. 
1—6. 

But  let  us  view  this  covetousness,  which  hath  brought  depravity 
into  the  world,  near  at  hand,  1,  with  respect  to  its  root,  2,  with 
respect  to  its  branches  and  fruits,  and  3,  with  respect  to  the  degrees 
of  its  growth. 

The  rootsin  of  covetousness  is,  (a)  that  the  sinner  lacks  the  all- 
sufficient  God,  who  alone  can  fill  and  satisfy  the  heart  fully  :  M  He 
comes  short  of  the  glory  of  God  by  sin,"  Rom.  iii.  23,  and  "  is 
alienated  from  the  life  of  God."  Eph.  iv.  18,  whereby  his  soul,  being 
like  an  empty  vessel,  seeks  to  be  filled,  and  pants  insatiably  after  all 
that  appears  to  him  honourable,  pleasant  and  profitable,  and  so  the 
sinner  is  like  "  a  greedy  dog,  and  he  can  never  have  enough,"  as 
the  Lord  speaks  of  the  watchmen  of  his  people,  Isaiah  Jvi  11,  12. 
(b)  Covetousness  proceeds  also  from  an  irregular  selflove,  by  which 
a  person  makes  himself  the  only  object  of  whatsoever  he  doth,  and 
therefore  endeavours  to  heap  up  for  himself  whatsoever  appears  to 
him  desirable.  The  apostle  teacheth  that  those,  w  ho  are  "  lovers 
of  themselves,  are  lovers  of  pleasures  more  than  of  God."  2 
Tim.  iii.  2,  4.  (c)  This  root  comprehends  also  pride,  from  which 
ariseth  an  imagination,  that  we  deserve  more  than  we  have,  yea, 
what  our  neighbour  hath.  It  was  this  pride,  which  induced  Absa- 
lom to  covet  his  father's  kingdom,  2  Sam.  xv.  1,  6.  (d)  Eartnly- 
mindedness  excites  also  to  sinful  covetousness  ;  for  this  renders  a 
person  so  sottishly  addicted  to  "  the  lust  of  the  flesh,  the  Just  of 
the  eyes,  and  the  pride  of  life,  that  he  esteems  his  belly  his  God, 
places  his  glory  in  his  shame,  and  minds  only  earthly  things."  See 
1  John  ii.  16,  and  Philip,  iii,  19.  It  cannot  be  otherwise,  but  that 
these  roots  must  bear  many  branches  of  gall  and  wormwood.  For 
they  excite  the  desires  (a)  to  forbidden  things,  as  Eve  desired  the 
fruit  of  the  forbidden  tree,  Gen.  iii.  6.  (b)  To  indifferent  and  law- 
Vol.  ii.  2  X 


378        THE  TENTH  COMMANDMENT  EXPLAINED. 

fill  things,  but  too  immoderately  and  insatiably  ;  men  will  have  for 
instance  too  great  a  desire  to  eating  and  drinking,  like  "  the  riotous- 
eaters  of  flesh,  and  the  wine-bibbers,"  of  whom  Solomon  speaks, 
Piov.  xxiii  20  ;  too  immoderate  a  desire  to  marry,  like  Shechem, 
the  son  of  Hamor,  Gen.  xxxv.  ii — 19  ;  an  impatient  desire  for  chil- 
dren, like  Rachel,  Gen.  xxx.  1  ;  and  an  insatiable  love  of  money,  a 
desire  to  be  rich,  1  Tim.  vi.  9,  10.  (c)  From  these  evil  roots  pro- 
ceeds also  a  desire  to  good  and  divine  things  with  an  evil  end,  that 
We  may  obtain  a  name,  and  get  gain  by  them,  as  Simon  the  sor- 
cerer desired  the  gifts  of  the  Spirit,  Acts  viii.  18,  19.  See  also 
Janus  iv.   13. 

These  evil  branches  bring  forth  also  many  evil  fruits.  They  are 
the  causes  of  all  other  sins  :  "  Every  man,"  saith  James,  "  is  drawn 
away  of  his  own  lust,  and  enticed  i  hen  when  lust  hath  conceived, 
it  bringelh  foitli  sin,"  James  i.  14,  15.  1  will  mention  a  few  of 
these  bitter  fruits,  as  (a)  sinful  thoughts,  which  muse  too  long  or 
unseasonably  upon  visible  things ;  to  which  also  belongs  forming 
chimerical  schemes  or  plans  ;  for  instance,  the  fool  thinks  through 
his  covetousness,  If  1  were  but  so  wise,  or  so  rich,  or  had  such  an 
office,  then  I  would  do  this  or  that.  Or  a  person  muses  upon  sinful 
and  abominable  things,  sometimes  waking  and  sometimes  also  sleep- 
ing, suffering  "  vain  thoughts  to  lodge  within  him,"  as  the  prophet 
compkiins,  Jer.  iv.  14.  (b)  Opposing,  suppressing,  and  stifling  the 
good  mo  ions,  which  the  Holy  Spirit  excites  m  the  conscience,  that 
the  sinner  may  oppose  his  covetousness,  but  he  "quenches  the  Spi- 
rit," contrary  to  the  admonition  of  Paul,  1  Thess.  v.  19,  and  "his 
flesh  lusteth  against  the  Spirit,"  as  the  same  apostle  speaks  Gal.  v. 
17.  And  because  he  cannot  satisfy  his  lust,  by  obeying  the  Loid, 
therefore  he  resists  the  Lord  ;  for  u  the  carnal  mind  is  enmity  against 
God  :  for  it  is  not  subject  to  the  law  of  God,  neither  indeed  can  be," 
according  to  Kom.  viii.  7.  (cj  Utithankfulrtcsa  ;  doih  God  bestow 
good  things  upon  him,  he  is  not  thankful,  because  he  dotes  upon 
tiie  good  things  of  others  ;  he  murmurs  and  frets  against  the  Lord, 
because  he  may  not  have  that  which  belongeth  to  his  neighbour  : 
"These,"  saith  Jude  in  his  epistle,  vs.  16,  "are  murmurers,  com- 
plainer$,  walking  after  their  own  lusts"  (d)  It  is  also  an  evil  fruit 
of  covetousness,  that  men  are  Urged  by  it  10  grudging  and  to  other 
sordid  vices,  because  they  may  not  have  what  another  hath;  for 
"  the  works  of  the  flesh  are"  not  only  "  lasciviousness  and  idolatry," 
but  also  "  witchcraft,  hatred,  variance,  emulation,  wrath,  strife,  sedi- 
tions, envyings,  murders,"  as  the  aposde  speaks,  Gal    v.  19 — 21. 

Rut  this  covetousness  doth  hot  arrive  to  its  full  height  and  strength 
at  once,  but  grows  grauuuily. 


XLIV.  LORD'S  DAY.  Q.  1 1 3—1  is.  T9 

1.  Covetousness  is  a  habit,  and  that  foul  source,  or  inherent  cri- 
minal sin,  from  which  every  active  desire  that  is  sinful  proceeds. 
The  reason  why  ';  the  -wickedness  of  Mali  is  great  in  the  earth  i?, 
that  the  invagination  of  the  thoughts  of  his  heart  is  only  evi!  con- 
tinually," as  die  Lord  saith,  Gen.  vi.  5.  M  For  otrt  o!  ■!  ■•  he  iM  pro- 
ceed evil  thoughts,"  &c.  Matt.  xv.  19,  and  "as  a  fountain  casteth 
out  her  waters,  so  "  the  heart  "  casteth  out  its  wlc&ednessy'  Jer. 
vi.  7.  This  habitual  covetousness  is  called  by  Paul,  Rom.  vii.  17, 
18,  23,  26, "  indwelling  sin j  the  flesh,  the  law  of  sin."  That  this 
habitual  covetousness  is  also  forbidden  here  is  evident;  for  "the 
efi& of  the  commandmenl  is  charity,  out  of  a  pure  heart,"  1  Tim. 
i.  5,  and  the  law    w.  given  to  mankind,  when  they  were  perfect. 

2.  From  this  proceeds  that  first  ebullition  and  notion,  which  pro- 
vokes to  sin,  while  it  is  not  approved,  or  followed  with  a  contrivance 
to  execute  it,  yea,  is  even  resisted  and  suppressed.  The  Papists,  So- 
cinians  and  Remonstrants  deny  that  these  first  motions  of  lust  are 
sins  and  forbidden,  not  only  because  they  do  not  acknowledge  origin- 
al righteousness,  but  also  because  they  must  in  this  manner  defend 
their  vainglorious  freewill,  and  the  perfection  of  the  saints  ;  for  the^- 
see  inJeed  that  they  cannot  prevent  these  ebullitions.  But  that  theste 
first  motions  are  forbidden  is  evident,  (a)  from  this  tenth  command- 
ment, which  doth  not  limit,  but  forbiddeth  all  covetousness.  (b)  Paul 
saith,  Rom.  vii.  7,  "  I  had  not  known  lust  to  be  sin,  except  the  law 
had  said,  Thou  shalt  not  covet."  Did  not  he,  who  was  brought  urv 
at  the  feet  of  Gamaliel,  know  before  his  conversion,  that  lust  to  whiclh 
we  assent,  and  which  we  contrive  how  to  execute,  was  sin  ?  Eveu 
the  heatiiens  could  know  this.  He  speaks  then  of  those  emotions  , 
that  rise  first  of  al*.  (c)  This  covetousness  militates  against  perfec  t 
love,  and  against  the  Spirit,  according  to  Matt.  xxii.  37 — 40.  Gal 
v.  17.  (d)  according  to  the  words  of  James,  "  a  man  is  drawn> 
away  and  enticed  by  his  own  lust,  upon  which'  lust  conr.eiveth  and 
bringeth  forth  sin,"  James  i.  14,15.  What  lust  must  we  under- 
stand here,  by  that  which  draws  away,  entices  and  conaeives  but  that 
first  ebullition  which  draws  away,  entices  and  conceives  by  the  pleas- 
ure that  it  takes  in  sin,  and  in  contriving  to  execute  it  ?  It  is  true, 
this  lust  is  distinguished  from  the  sin  that  it  conceives  and  brings 
forth  ;  yet  not  in  order  to  deny  its  sinfulness,  but  to  distinguish  a 
less  from  a  greater  sin,  and  to  shew  how  a  less  sin  brings  forth  a 
greater,  as  Paul  also  saith,  that  "sin,  taking  occasion  by  the  com- 
mandment, wrought  in  him  all  manner  of  concupiscence,"  Rom.  vii. 
S.  That  which  brings  forth  sin  is  surely  sin  ;  for  like  brings  forth 
like. 

3.  From  this  foul  source,  and   from  these  sinful  ebullitions  pro- 
ceeds also  that  assent   to   lust,  by  which  we   take  a  pleasure  in  it, 


380        THE  TENTH  COMMANDMENT  EXPLAINED, 

muse  on  it  with  delight,  cherish  it,  and  suffer  ourselves  to  be  urged 
to  fulfil  it,  when  we  have  an  opportunity,  and  are  able  :  and  in  this 
manner  doth  "  lust  conceive  and  bring  forth  sin,"  James  i.   15. 

2.  When  God  forbids  a  sin,  he  then  also  commands  the  contrary 
virtue  ;  for  we  cannot  avoid  sin  except  by  pursuing  virtue,  and  there- 
fore God  commands  here, 

'  1 .  Regeneration  after  the  image  of  God,  inasmuch  as  this  restrains 
and  subdueth  the  strength  of  sinful  concupiscence.  Therefore  the 
prophet  saith,  "  Circumcise  yourselves  to  the  Lord,  and  take  away 
the  foreskins  of  your  heart,"  Jer.  iv.  4.  We  "  cast  away  our  trans- 
gressions by  making  ourselves  a  new  heart  and  a  new  spirit,"  as  we 
read,  Ezek.  xviii.  31. 

2.  Satisfaction  in  God,  whereby  all  our  desires,  being  filled  with 
him;  are  listless  towards  sin  :  "  Whom  have  I  in  heaven  but  thee  ? 
and  there  is  none  upon  earth  that  I  desire  besides  thee,"  saith 
Asaph  to  the  Lord,  Psalm  lxxiii.  25.  So  llabakkuk  also  expresseth 
himself  in  his  prophecy,  ch.  iii    17,   18. 

3.  Contentment  with  that  portion  of  earthly  goods,  which  God 
bestows  on  us.  Paul  "  having  learned  in  whatsoever  state  he  was, 
•therewith  to  he  content,"  Philip,  iv.  11,  exhorts  others  also  "  to  be 
content  with  such  things  as  they  have,"  Heb.  xiii.  5. 

'4,  Joy  and  pleasure  in  our  neighbour's  welfare,  so  that'  we  "  re- 
joice with  them  who  do  rejoice,"  Rom.  xii.    15. 

5.  Hatred  and  opposition  to  all  that  is  sinful,  by  which  we  en- 
.deavour  to  subdue  and  mortify  all  our  lusts,  according  to  the  admo- 
nition of  the  apostle,  Col.  iii.  5,  for  thus  "  we  abstain  from  fleshly 
lusts,  which  war  against  the  soul,"  as  Peter  requireth,  1  Peter  ii.  11. 

6.  An  insatiable  desire,  and  active  inclination  to  all  righteousness, 
-by  which,  with  David  and  Paul,  "  we  delight  in  the  law  and  com- 
mandments of  God,  afteV  the  inner  man,"  Psalm  cxix.  47,  131. 
Rom.  vii.  22. 

3.  The  sinful  heart  will  not  submit  to  such  a  restraint,  it  imagines 
that  this  would  be  unreasonable.  But  this  "  commandment  is  holy, 
just  and  good,"  as  Paul  said  of  it,  when  he  saw  himself  condemned 
by  it,  Rom.  vii.  12.  For  (a)  covetousness  militates  against  the  sove- 
reignty of  God  over  the  heart.  Therefore  he  also  mark*  it  strictly, 
»nd  will  judge  it,  according  to  Jer.  xvii.  9,  10.  Rom.  ii.  16,  and 
f-quires  that  the  pet  son,  who  is  in  covenant  with  him,  should  be 
,  as  the  Lord  his  God  is  holy,  Lev.  xix.  2.  We  must  there- 
fore "  put  off  the  old  man,  which  is  corrupt  according  to  the  deceit- 
ful lusts  :  and  be  renewed  in  the  spirit  of  our  minds;  and  put  on 
the  new  man,  which  after  God  is  created  in   righteousness  and  true 


XL1V.  LORD'S  DAY.  Q.  113—115.  381 

holiness,"  Eph,  iv.  22 — 24  Yea,  covetousness  militates  also  against 
the  providence  of  God,  who  gives  to  every  man  as  much  as  he  plea- 
seth.  Therefore  when  God  bestows  any  good  thing  upon  our 
neighbour,  and  withholds  it  from  us,  "  shall  our  eye  be  evil,  because 
God  is  good,"  as  the  Saviour  asks,  disapproving  of  such  a  temper, 
Malt.  xx.  15.  (b)  It  is  also  vaniiy  to  be  so  intent  upon  earthly 
matteis  ;  for  it  is  vain  to  rise  up  early,  to  sit  up  late,  and  to  eat  the 
bread  of  sorrow  :  for  so  he  giveth  his  beloved  sleep,"  Psalm  cxxvii. 
2.  Neither  can  the  capacious  soul  be  satisfied  with  all  these  visible 
things  ;  the  round  world  cannot  fill  the  triangular  heart :  "  The  eye 
is  not  satisfied  with  seeing,  nor  the  ear  filled  with  hearing,"  saith 
the  wise  king,  Eccl.  i.  8.  God  alone  is  able  to  fill  the  rational  soul, 
and  to  afford  her  a  satisfying  pleasure  with  his  allsufficiency.  See 
2  Cor.  ix.  8. 

II  We  have  thus  explained  the  whole  law :  but  we  do  still  not 
understand  it,  if  we  do  not  rightly  comprehend  the  end,  for  which 
the  law  was  given.  To  what  purpose  then  is  the  law  ?  To  teach 
us  that  man  can  keep  it  perfectly,  after  it  is  once  become  weak 
through  the  flesh  I  Paul  denies  this,  when  he  saith,  Gal.  iii.  21, 
11  If  there  had  been  a  law  given,  which  could  have  given  life,  verily 
righteousness  should  have  been  by  the  law."  To  explain  this  more 
particularly,  we  will,  with  the  instructor,  inquire,  (1)  whether  those 
who  are  converted  to  God  can  keep  the  law  perfectly,  and  if  not,  (2) 
why  God  suffers  it  to  be  preached  to  us  so  strictly. 

We  presuppose  that  man,  before  the  fall  was  both  obliged,  and 
able  to  keep  the  law,  in  order  to  obtain  life  by  his  own  righteous- 
ness ;  that  since  the  fall,  and  since  the  upraising  of  the  elect  sinner, 
man  is  still  obliged  to  keep  the  law  perfectly  ;  for  he  should  other- 
wise not  sin  any  more  :  neither  can  he  ever  be  discharged  from  a 
perfect  obligation  to  the  Supreme  Ruler,  because  as  long  as  he  is 
a  creature,  and  the  Lord  is  God,  so  long  he  is  in  every  respect  sub- 
ject to  God.  We  maintain  also  that  the  sinner,  while  in  the  state  of 
nature,  is  wholly  unable  to  do  aught  that  is  good,  as  we  have  shown 
on  the  eighth  and  ninth  questions.  But  the  subject  of  our  present 
inquiry  is,  whether  those  who  are  converted  to  God  can  keep  the 
law  perfectly.  We  allow  that  believers  possess,  in  consequence  of 
their  new  birth,  a  certain  ability  for  that  which  is  good.  We  also 
acknowledge  that  they  possess  a  certain  perfection,  not  only  with  re- 
spect to  justification,  by  which  <l  they  are  perfect  in  Christ,"  as 
Paul  saith,  Col.  ii.  10,  but  also  with  respect  to  sanctification,  even  a 
perfection  of  sincerity,  and  of  parts,  of  soul  and  body,  a  perfect  heart 
and  "  a  sincere  resolution  to  live,  not  only  according  to  some,  but 


382       THE  TENTH  COMMANDMENT  EXPLAINED. 

according  to  all  the  commands  of  God,"  as  David  and  Hezekiah  tes- 
tify concerning   themselves,    Psalm  cxix.   128.     Isaiah  xxxviii.  3. 
Moreover,  one  believer  is  said  to    be  more  perfect   than  another,  on 
account  of  his  greater  proficiency  :  "  Strong   meat     belongeth    to 
them  who  are  perfect,"*  Heb.  v.   14.     But  the  question  is,  whether 
a  believer  can  in  this  present  life  be  perfect,  with  respect  to  degrees, 
and  thus  be  wholly  sinless.     This  is  the  doctrine  of  the  Papists,  So- 
cinians  and  Remonstrants.     They  cannot  otherwise  maintain   the 
doctrine  of  their  indifferent  freewill.     Yea,  the  Papists  conceive  that 
they  can  be  more  than   perfect  by  their  works  of  supererogation  : 
and  the  Socinians  think  that  tney  can  be  more  perfect  than  the  law 
of  Moses  required,  because  they  must  now  live  according  to  the  im- 
proved law  of  Christ ;  but  we  deny  such  a  perfection   of  the   saints. 
It  those  persons,  who  boast  so  much  of  their  perfection,    knew    the 
unspotted  holiness  of   God,  and  the   spirituality  of  the  law,  and   if 
they  were  only  experimentally  convinced  with  Paul  by  the  tenth  com- 
mandment, "  that  lust  is  sin,"  they  would  assent  to   the   doctrine, 
that  the  saints  cannot  be  perfect  in  this  life.     They   ought   at    least 
to  have    learned    better   from    the    word    of  God :    for  that  saith, 
(I)  That  all  men,  and   therefore  those   also,  who   are  converted    to 
God,  have  sins  :  "  There  is  no    man  who    sinneth   not,"  saith    wise 
Solomon,  1  Kings  viii.  46.     Prov   xx.  9.     Eccl.  vii.  20.   "  In  many 
things  we  offend  all,"  saith  James  in  his    epistle,  chap.  iii.  2,   and 
John  saith,  "  If  we  say  that   we   have  no  sin.  we   deceive  ourselves, 
and  the  truth  is  net  in  us,"    1  John  i.  8.      The    most   holy    persons 
also  acknowledge,  that  they   are  guilty  of  sin  ;  see  this  in  that  most 
upright  man   Job.  chap.  ix.  2,  3 — in  the  man  after  God's  own  heart, 
Psalm  xix.  12.     exxx.  3.     cxliii.  2,  and  in  that  highly   enlightened 
apostle,  Philip,  iii.  12.     (2)  "  The  holiest  men   have  but   small  be- 
ginnings of  this  perfect  obedience."     Paul   and   other    great   saints 
"  knew  and  prophesied   but   in  part,"   1  Cor.  xiii.  9,  10.       He   and 
the  holy  Romans    bad   only  "the    first-fruits  of  the   Spirit,"  Rom. 
■viii.  23.     Now  we  know  what  a  small  beginning  of  the    harvest  the 
first-fruits  are.     (3)  The   most  that  the  saints   have  is,  that  "with  a 
sincere  resolution  they  begin  to  live  not  only  according  to  some,  but 
according  to  all  the  commandments  of  God."     See  David's  longing 
Psalm  cxix.  5,  and    Paul's  panting  after  perfection,    Philip,   iii.   12, 
15.     "  To  will  is  present  with  me,  but  how  to  perform  that  which  is 
good,  I  find  not,"  Rom.  vii.  18.     And  what    hindereth    them  from 
being  perfect  in/tins  life  ?  is  it  not  their  remaining  corruptions   and 

•  This  is  aj-reeablc  to  the  Dutch  translation. 


XLIV.  LORD'S  DAY".  Q.   113—115.  333 

iusis,  that  "when  they  would  do  good,  evil  is  present  with  them, 
and  they  are  brought  into  captivity  to  the  law  of  sin,  which  is  in  their 
members,"  Rom.  vii.  21,  23.  See  how  the  same  Paul  speaks,  GaL 
v.   17. 

When  it  is  said,  that  the  most  holy  persons,  who  have  made  a 
greater  proficiency  than  others,  "  have  only  small  beginnings  of 
obedience  to  God,"  it  cloth  not  follow  therelrom,  that  those  who  are 
least  holy,  and  are  nevertheless  truly  converted,  have  nothing  at  all  of 
this  obedience ;  for  the  most  holy,  when  they  are  compared  with 
the  perfect  demand  of  God's  law,  and  the  state  of  perfection  after 
this  life,  cannot  have  more  than  such  small  beginnings  ;  but  if  we 
compare  them  with  those,  who  have  made  the  least  proficiency,  then 
they  are,  as  it  were,  perfect,  and  those  least  holy  persons  are  like 
children,  who  are  yet  busy  with  first  principles,  according  to  Jtleb* 
v.  12—  14. 

We  read  indeed  often  of  the  saints,  that  "  they  walk  with  a  per- 
fect heart  in  all  the  commandments  of  the  Lord  blameless,"  as  it  is 
said  of  David,  1  Kings  ix.  4.  xiv  8.  Acts  xiii.  22,  and  of  Heze- 
kiah,  2  Kings  xviii  6,  and  of  Zacharias,  Luke  i.  6.  But  the  sins 
of  those  saints  are  too  well  known  that  we  should  conclude  there- 
from, that  they  had  attained  to  a  perfection  of  degrees.  These 
phrases  only  intimate  that  they  possessed  a  perfection  of  parts,  which 
doth  not  exclude  their  stumblings.  Though  "  Asa  took  not  away 
the  high  places,  and  was  guilty  of  other  sins,  nevertheless  the  heart 
of  Asa  was  perfect  all  his  days,"  2  Chron.  xv.  17.     xvi.  2 — 12. 

"  Why  then  will  God  have  the  ten  commandments  so  strictly 
preached,  since  no  man  in  this  life  can  keep  them  *"  Thus  asks 
the  instructor  from  the  mouth  of  our  adversaries,  who  assert  that 
the  strict  preaching  of  the  law  is  an  evidence,  that  we  can  keep  it 
perfectly.  Before  we  remove  this  difficulty,  we  say  that  the  strict 
pieaching  of  the  law  doth  not  consist  in  urging  it  as  the  condition 
of  the  covenant  of  works,  that  we  may  seek  life  by  it,  or  as  a  spe- 
cial ministration  of  the  Old  Testament  ;  for  in  this  respect  believ- 
ers are  "  no  longer  under  the  law,"  Rom.  vi.  14.  Gal  iii.  25,  and 
in  this  respect  Christ  hath  fulfilled  it  for  them,  Rom.  viii.  3,  4,  but 
in  seriously  exhibiting  it,  as  an  everlasting  rule  of  obedience,  in  all 
its  extent,  obligations,  threatenings  and  promises.  We  may  not 
preach  the  law  thus,  say  the  Antinomians.  But  Christ  and  his 
apostles  preached  it  in  this  strict  manner.  Paul  requires  that  Titus 
should  "rebuke  sharply  and  with  all  authority,"  Titus  i.  13.  ii.  15. 
We  are,  and  always  will  remain  obligated  to  obey  God,  on  account 
of  his  sovereignty,  and  this  everlasting  obligation  is  rendered   still 


884        THE  TENTH  COMMANDMENT  EXPLAINED. 

Stronger  by  grace  :  "Christ,"  saith  the  apostle,  Titus  ii.  14,  "gave 
himself  for  us,  that  he  might  redeem  us  from  all  iniquity,  and  pu- 
rify unto  himself  a  peculiar  people,  zealous  of  good  works."  Ought 
not  this  obligation  then  to  be  urged,  and  therefore  strictly  preached  ? 
But  if  the  law  must  be  preached  so  strictly,  we  must  then  be 
able  to  keep  it  perfectly,  otherwise  it  will  be  in  vain  to  preach  it  so 
strictly,  say  the  patrons  of  the  perfection  of  the  saints.  But  no  duty 
declares  what  we  can,  but  what  we  ought  to  do,  as  we  have  shown 
upon  the  eighth  and  ninth  question.  And  though  God  doth  not 
require  that  the  law  should  be  preached  strictly,  because  we  can 
keep  it,  yet  there  are  other  reasons  for  this.  It  is  proper  to  preach 
it  strictly,  in  order  to  condemn  and  restrain  the  reprobates  ;  "  for 
whose  sake  the  law  was  given,"  according  to  1  Tim.  i.  9,  10,  and  to 
convince  the  elect  before  they  are  converted  in  order  to  their  conver- 
sion, and  to  urge  them  to  the  Mediator,  Rom.  iii.  20.  x.  4.  But  besides 
this,  the  strict  preachingof  the  law  is  serviceable  to  believers,  (a)  "  That 
all  their  lifetime  they  may  learn  more  and  more  to  know  their  sinful 
nature."  For  they  are  by  this  mean  humbled,  and  rendered  capable  of 
more  grace,  as  the  heart  of  Josiah  became  "  tender,"  when  the  law  was 
read  to  him,  2  Kings  xxti.  11—22.  (b) "  That  they  may  thus  be- 
come the  more  earnest  in  seeking  the  remission  of  sins,  and  righ- 
teousness in  Christ."  For  the  law  teafcfteth  them  the  necessity  of 
remission,  anJ  the  gospel  revealing  Christ  to  them,  they  are  urged 
to  him.  Paul,  convinced  of  his  condition  by  the  law,  cried  out  for 
deliverance  through  Christ,  Rem.  vii.  24.  D  •  d  did  this  before 
him,  Psalm  xxxii,  li.  (c)  "  That  they  may  constantly  endeavour 
and  pray  to  God  for  his  grace,"  &c.  The  law,  when  it  is  preached 
strictly,  exhibits  perfect  holiness  in  all  its  lustre,  and  believers  being 
in  consequence  of  this,  smitten  with  the  love  of  it,  "  press  after  per- 
fection," with  Paul,  Philip,  iii.  12,  13,  and  pray  earnestly  for  the 
grace  of  God,  that  he  would  cause  thertl  to  keep  his  law.  Hear 
what  the  great  lover  of  the  law  saith  to  the  Lord.  Psalm  cxix.  4,  5. 
"  Thou  hast  commanded  me  to  keep  thy  precepts  diligently.  O 
that  my  ways  were  directed  to  keep  thy  statutes."  We  might  as- 
sign other  reasons  for  preaching  the  law  strictly  to  believers,  as,  that 
they  may  thus  see  what  Chvis*.  hath  done  for  them  ;  that  the  law 
is  a  rule  of  thankfulness  to  them,  who  are  God's  covenant  peoples 
and  that  the  law  is  to  them  an  evidence  of  the  grace  of  God,  since' 
they  have  the  law  in  their  hearts,  and  they  delight  in  it,  and  observ? 
it:  but  we  may  not  insist  too  long  on  these  thing 


XLIV.  LORD'S  DAY.  Q.  113—115.  385 


APPLICATION. 

So  long,  hearers,  have  ye  heard  the  strict  preaching  of  the  law. 
But  hath  it  answered  these  good  purposes  with  you  ?  burely  many 
of  you  have  not  yet  been  properly  advantaged  by  it.  It  is  evi- 
dent ;  for 

1.  The  most  of  you  know  not  yet  their  sinful  nature.  Some 
know  indeed  that  they  have  sinned  ;  but  do  ye  indeed  see  that  your 
very  nature  is  sinful,  that  ye  are  thoroughly  leavened  with  sin,  and 
that  it  is  become,  as  it  were,  your  second  nature  to  sin  ?  no,  ye  do 
not  know  your  sinful  lusting  ;  ye  think  that  if  ye  do  not  render 
yourselves  guilty  of  gross  sins,  ye  are  already  very  virtuous  ;  ye 
know  not  with  an  inward,  experimental  knowledge,  that  lust  is  sinful 
in  you,  although  the  law  saith,  "  Thou  shalt  not  covet,"  and  ye 
dare  think,  yea,  even  say,  that  ye  are  not  covetous,  but  content  with 
your  own.  Why  should  we  wonder,  for  ye  never  come  to  your- 
selves, and  do  not  look  to  the  bottom  of  your  corrupt  hearts,  and 
thus  "  do  not  know  the  plague  of  your  hearts,"  as  is  required,  1 
Kings  viii.  38. 

2.  Many  sin  and  are  careless,  from  an  observation  of  the  imper- 
fections of  the  saints.  What  thinkest  thou,  O  sinner,  when  thy 
lust  enticeth  thee  to  this  and  that  sin,  dost  thou  not  then  venture  to 
commit  it,  because  the  saints  defiled  themselves  with  such  sins  ? 
and  when  thy  conscience  reproves  thee  on  account  of  thine  abomi- 
nations, dost  thou  not  then  flatter  thyself  that,  since  the  saints  obtain- 
ed the  forgiveness  of  their  sins,  thou  also  wilt  obtain  forgiveness  ? 
but  do  thy  sins  distress  thee  as  much  as  the  sins  of  the  saints  dis- 
tressed them  ?  and  cio  they  cause  thee  to  seek  with  such  earnestness, 
forgiveness  and  righteousness  in  Christ,  and  to  fight  and  guard  more 
earnestly  through  the  grace  of  the  Lord  against  sin,  as  the  sins  of 
the  saints  constrained  them  to  do  ?  See  this  in  David  and  Josiah, 
Psalm  li.  2  Chron.  xxxiv.  19 — 27.  And  it  is  still  baser,  that  many 
of  you  watch  for  the  failings  of  the  saints,  in  order  to  scoff  at  them, 
and  to  reproach  them  on  account  of  their  failings,  with  much  sar- 
castic bitterness,  both  in  their  presence  and  absence  :  "  men  watch 
for  their  halting,"  as  the  prophet  complains,  Jer.  xx.  10,  "  and 
when  they  halt,  rejoice,"  as  David  experienced  to  his  sorrow,  Psalm 
xxxv.  15.  But  if  ye  knew  their  distress  on  account  of  their  hailing, 
ye  would  not  add  to  their  sorrow.  David  had  therefore  reason  to 
say  to  the  Lord,  Psalm  xxxviii.  16,  17.  "Lest  they  should  rejoice 
over  me  :  when  my  foot  slippeth,  they  magnify  themselves  against

me.  For  I  am  ready  to  halt,  and  my  sorrow  is  continually  be- 
fore me." 

3.  There  are  few  who  make  a  right  use  of  the  preaching  of  the 
law  ;  for  some  cannot  and  will  not  hear  the  strict  preaching  of  the 
law,  they  cannot  endure  that  probing  of  their  hearts,  and  it  provokes 
them  to  indignation  against  the  preacher  of  the  law.  Is  it  not  tiue  ? 
will  ye  not  hate  him,  speak  evil  of  him,  depart  from  him,  and 
turn  away  your  ears,  while  he  preaches,  from  hearing  the  law  ?  The 
surly  temper  of  God's  ancient  people  prevails  also  in  many  of  you. 
See  this  wickedness  detected  and  threatened,  Isaiah  xxx.  9 — 14. 
lix.  Amos  v.  10.  Others  are  better  pleased  with  the  preaching  of 
the  law  :  they  hear  willingly  a  wise  reprover,  and  even  say  that  he 
cannot  preach  too  sharply  ;  but  they  do  not  proceed  any  further. 
Some  of  you  are  indeed  at  times  alarmed,  and  are  afraid  with  Felix  ; 
but  ye  seek  to  divert  it,  as  he  did,  Acts  xxiv.  25,  or  are  with 
"  Agrippa  almost  persuaded  to  become  Christians,"  Acts  xxvi.  28, 
but  this  is  all  that  comes  of  it  ;  and  If  it  produce  any  effect,  it  will 
not  induce  you  to  seek  with  restlessness,  pardon  and  righteousness 
in  Christ ;  this  ye  neglect ;  but  endeavour  to  amend  in  some  meas- 
ure your  evil  doings ;  and  when  ye  advance  a  little  therein,  ye 
think  that  God  will  overlook  all  your  shortcomings,  as  weaknesses  : 
and  ye  have  thus,  like  the  Jews,  "  a  zeal  for  God  ;  but  not  according 
to  knowledge  :  for  ye  are  ignorant  of  God's  righteousness,  and  go 
about  to  establish  your  own  righteousness  ;  and  do  not  thus  submit 
yourselves  to  the  righteousness  of  God,"  Rom.  x.  2,  3.  For  ye 
seek  not  your  salvation  and  rest  in  "Christ,  who  is  the  end  of  the 
law  for  righteousness  to  every  one  that  believeth,"  vs.  4,  but  in  your 
own  doings. 

Therefore  all  that  ye  have  heard  so  long  a  time,  of  the  law,  hath 
been  unprofitable,  and  of  no  service  tojou.  And  consequently  the 
whole  law,  with  ail  its  commands  and  threatenings,  is  yet  against 
you,  and  ye  lie  under  the  ciKse  of  the  law,  which  is  denounced 
against  the  transgressors,  Gal.'iii.  10,  12,  and  ye  never  will,  while 
yc  remain  in  your  present  condition,  surmount  it ;  "  for  God  will 
by  no  means  clear  the  gu  ity."  Exod.  xxxiv.  7,  and  ye  arc  guilty 
before  him.  Will  ye  flee  bom  the  wrath  to  come,  flee  then  to  the 
Son  of  God,  in  order  to  obt  tin  in  him  grace  and  mercy  of  the  Lord ; 
«  for  Christ  is  the  end  of  the  law  lb.-  righteousness  to  every  one  that 
believeth/'  Rom.  x 

But  ye,  O  bel  vers  nrtist  also  still  make  use  of  the  law,  though 
yea'-e  not  any  longer  under  the  law,  but  under  grace,  and  the  right- 
eousness of  U*e  law   is  i'uifuUu   ui   yuu  tlnough  the  satisfaction  of 


XLIV.  LORD'S  DAY.  Q.  1 1C — \15.  387 

Christ ;    for   the   law  must   yet   be   strictly   preached  to  you  also. 
Tli  ere  fore, 

1.  Exercise  yourselves  yet  daily  in  seeking  a  knowledge  of  your 
sins,  that  ye  may  become  more  and  more  acquainted  with  your  sin- 
ful nature.  When  God  began  to  lay  his  good  hand  on  you,  in  order 
to  convert  you,  he  discovered  to  you  indeed  your  abominableness 
and  guilt,  yet  he  discovered  it  only  in  part  ;  but  now  ye  must  behold 
still  greater  abominations.  Therefore  examine  yourselves  olten  by 
the  law,  and  compare  yourselves  with  all  that  is  commanded  and 
forbidden  in  it ;  give  strict  heed  to  your  heart,  and  observe  what  en- 
ters in,  and  what  goeth  out  of  it,  and  whither  it  would  mislead  you, 
if  the  Lord  did  not  restrain  you  by  his  grace,  yea,  how  often  it  actu- 
ally seduces  you,  against  your  sine,  re  and  determined  resolution, 
Descend  often  into  yourselves,  that  ye  may  see  that  filthy  bottom, 
and  your  concupiscence,  as  the  first  headspring  of  your  sinful  nature, 
and  how  that  sinful  nature  becomes  active,  when  the  hatefulness  of 
sin  is  exhibited  by  a  prohibition  of  it.  Paul  learned  to  know  his  sin- 
ful nature  in  this  manner  ;  for  he  saith,  Rom.  vii.  8  11,13.  u  Sin, 
taking  occasion  by  the  commandment,  wrought  in  me  all  manner  of 
concupiscence,  deceived  me,  and  by  it  slew  me.  Was  then  that 
■Which  is  good  made  death  unto  me  ?  God  forbid.  But  sin  was  made 
death  to  me,  that  it  might  appear  sin,  working  death  in  me  by  that 
which  is  good ;  that  sin  by  the  commandment  might  become  ex- 
ceeding sinful." 

2.  Beware  that  your  sight  of  your  sinful  nature,  and  your  sorrow 
for  it  do  not  render  you  impatient,  and  fretful  and  that  it  do  not 
discourage  you.  It  hath  pleased  the  Lord  to  lea\e  these  corruptions, 
as  thorns  in  your  eyes,  and  as  goads  in  your  sides,  in  order  to  hum- 
ble you,  that  ye  may  not  be  exalted  on  account  of  the  excellency  of 
the  revelation  ;  that  Christ  may  remain  precious  to  you,  and  that  he 
may  induce  you  to  seek  his  righteousness  continually  ;  and  also  that 
he  may  cause  you  to  be  to  the  glory  of  his  wisdom,  power  and  good- 
ness, since  he  is  able  to  lead  you  in  such  a  sinful  way  to  salvation. 
He  chooses  to  render  you  earnestly  desirous  of  th«  perfect  state  in 
heaven  ;  also  to  retain  you  in  a  state  of  warfare,  that  he  may  render 
you  conquerors,  and  may  crown  you  after  your  work  is  finished. 
Exercise  yourselves  then  in  these  things,  and  continue  engaged  in 
them. 

3.  Beware  of  reproaching  and  despising  others,  who  are  beset 
with  infirmities,  on  account  of  their  stumblings.  Ye  know  how 
your  own  sins  grieve  you  ;  think  not  that  other  godly  persons  take 
pleasure  in  theirs :  "  Brethren,"  saith  the  apostle,  Gal.  vi.  1,  "  if  a 


388       THE  TENTH  COMMANDMENT  EXPLAINED. 

man  be  overtaken  in  a  fault,  ye  which  are  spiritual,  restore  such  an 
one  in  the  spirit  of  meekness  j  considering  thyself,  lest  thou  also 
be  tempted." 

4.  Pursue  after  perfection,  though  ye  cannot  be  perfect.  To  in- 
dulge without  restraint  in  sin,  or  to  be  discouraged,  because  we  can- 
not attain  to  perfection  is  not  the  conduct  of  tender  Christians  ;  for 
they  rather  "reach  forth  to  it,"  with  Paul,  Philip  iii.  12 — u.  If 
we  will  be  in  earnest,  we  will  attain  to  perfection  after  this  life,  yea, 
in  this  life  we  may  always  become  more  perfect  than  we  are. 

5.  Every  believer  should  endeavour  to  labour  and  advance  accord- 
ing  to  his  proficiency.  As  the  man  is,  so  is  his  strength.  A  child, 
a  youth,  and  a  man  in  Christ  must  each  conduct  according  to,  and 
not  above  his  strength,  that  he  may  not  overtoil  himself.  This  the 
apostle  requireth,   Philip,  iii.  15,  16. 

Thus  the  law  will  not  be  a  terror  to  ycu  :  "  The  law  is  not  against 
such  persons,  and  it  was  not  made  fur  righteous  persons,"  as  the 
apostle  saith,  Gal.  v.  23.  1  Tim.  i.  9.  Your  endeavours  and  imper- 
fect obedience,  O  believers,  will  still  be  acceptable  to  God  :  "  For 
if  there  be  first  a  willing  mind,  it  is  accepted,  according  to  that  a 
man  hath,  and  not  according  to  that  he  hath  not,"  saith  Paul,  2 
Cor.  viii  12.  Having  such  a  perfect  heart,  ye  will  be  imboldened  to 
say  with  Heztkiah  to  the  Lord  in  the  hour  of  death,  "  Remember 
now.  O  Lord,  I  beseech  thee,  how  I  have  walked  before  thee  in 
truth,  and  with  a  perfect  heart,  and  have  done  that  which  is  good  in 
thy  sight,"  Isaiah  xxxviii.  3.  It  is  true,  your  lusts  and  imperfec- 
tions do  still  afflict  you,  but  they  will  soon  be  abolished,  and  your 
Head  and  Husband  Christ,  "  will  present  you  to  himself  a  glorious 
church,  not  having  spot,  or  wrinkle,  or  any  such  thing ;  but  holy 
and  without  blemish."  Thus  speaks  Paul,  Eph.  v.  27.  "  And  let 
all  the  people  say  Amen,  yea,  Amen,"

THE  WORK 


OF 


CHRISTIAN  PRAYER. 


XLV.  LORD'S  DAY. 


'  Philip,  iv.  6.  Be  careful  for  nothing:  but  in  every  thing  by  prayer 
and  supplication,  with  thanksgiving,  let  your  requests  be  made 
known  unto  God.

Q.  115.  Why  will  God  then  have  all  the  commands  so  strictly  preach- 
ed, since  no  man  in  this  life  can  keep  them  ? 


XLIV.  LORDS  DAY.  Q.  113—115.  375 

A.  First,  that  all  our  lifetime,  we  may  learn  more  and  more  to 
know  our  sinful  nature,  and  thus  become  more  earnest  in  seek'i.g 
the  remission  of  sin,  and  righteousness  in  Christ ;  likewise,  that  we 
constantly  endeavour  and  pray  to  God  for  the  grace  of  the  Holy 
Spirit,  that  we  m:y  become  more  and  more  conformable  to  the 
image  of  God,  till  we  arrive  at  the  perfection  proposed  to  us  in  a 
life  to  come. 

'  T 

JL  have  seen  an  end  of  all  perfection  :  but  thy  commandment  is 
exceeding  broad,"  saith  David,  Psalm  cxix.  96  No  visible  things 
are  so  perfect,  that  they  are  eternal  and  incorruptible  ;  "  for  the 
things  which  are  seen  are  temporal,"  2  Cor.  iv.  18,  nor  are  they  so 
perfect  that  they  have  "not  their  Hmits  ;  they  could  otherwise  afford 
human  beings  a  perfect  satisfaction,  and  would  not  be  accompanied 
with  any  sorrow.  Every  man  can  see  that  they  have  their  limits, 
and  might  be  more  perfect.  Although  a  man  should  be  ever  so 
much  enamoured  of  his  prosperity,  he  will  nevertheless  experience 
at  times  an  interruption  of  his  pleasure.  God  alone  is  infinitely 
perfect,  and  since  his  law  is  an  expression  of  his  perfection,  there- 
fore his  commandment  is  also  exceedingly  broad-  He  who  medi- 
tates in  it  day  and  night  will  find  continually  more  and  more  that 
there  are  unfathomable  depths  in  it,  his  delight  in  it  will  not  cease, 
nor  be  interrupted,  but  continually  renewed.  The  sweet  Psalm- 
ist hath  shown  this  in  the  hundred  and  nineteenth  psalm,  his 
heait  scarcely  indites  a  single  verse,  but  in  order  to  express 
his  pleasure  in  the  commands  of  the  Lord  :  for  '*  the  law  of  the 
Lord  is  perfect,  converting  the  soul,  making  wise  the  simple,  and 
rejoicing  the  heart ;"  thus  he  speaks,  Psalm  xix.  7,  3.  A  man  may 
find  all  that  he  must  either  believe  or  do  in  the  law  ;  it  forbids  all 
that  is  sinful ;  yea,  like  the  whole  word,  Heb.  iv.  12,  the  command- 
ment is  "  a  discerner  of  the  thoughts  and  intents  of  the  heart,"  "  The 
law  is  spiritual,"  saith  Paul,  Rom.  vii.  14.  It  extendeth  to  the  in- 
most desires  of  a  man's  spirit,  when  it  saith,  "  Tnou  shalt  not 
covet,"  &c. 

If  the  Lawgiver  had  forbidden  only  murder,  adultery,  stealing,, 
and  bearing  false  witness,  thf  sinner,  who  knows  neither  the  corrup- 
tion of  his  heart,  nor  the  perfect  holiness  of  God,  would  imagine 
that  the  outward  observation  of  these  commands  would  be  sufficient : 
but  the  Lord  prevents  this,  when  he  forbids  in  this  commandment 
also  the  unholiness  and  sinful  desires  of  bis  spirit. 

The  instructor  proposes  here  two  particulars  for  our  consideration  s 


376      THE  TENTH  COMMANDMENT  EXPLAINED, 

I.  The  nature  of  the  tenth  commandment,  Question  113. 

II.  1  he  end  of  the  giving  of  the  law,  Question  114,  115. 

1.  The  Lawgiver  forbids  "coveting  our  neighbour's  house,  wife> 
manservant,  maidservant,  ox,  ass,  and  aught  that  is  our  neighbour's," 
or,  belongs  to  him.  A  certain  proof,  that  this  commandment  re- 
lates to  loving  our  neighbour,  and  so  belongs  to  the  second  table. 
Yet  we  need  not  scruple  to  refer  it  also  to  the  first  table,  with  the 
catechism,  which  saith,  in  order  to  explain  this  commandment, 
"  that  even  the  smallest  inclination  or  thought  contrary  to  any  of 
God's  commandments  should  never  arise  in  our  hearts,"  See.  Paul 
saith,  Rom.  xiii.  10,  "  Love  worketh  no  ill  to  his  neighbour:  there- 
fore love  is  the  fulfilling  of  the  law."  Consequently  the  commands 
of  the  second  table  respect  also  the  commands  of  the  first,  which 
belong  also  to  the  law,  and  are  fulfilled  by  keeping  the  second  tablet 

The  Lawgiver  saith  twice,  "  Thou  Shalt  not  covet,"  once  with 
respect  to  our  neighbour's  house,  and  again  with  respect  to  his  wife. 
Surely  not-  in  order  to  give  us  here  two  distinct  commands,  as  the 
Papists  assert,  which  we  refuted,  when  we  divided  the  law  into  two 
tables,  in  treating  on  the  93d  question  :  but  the  Lord  repeats  the 
word  covet,  in  order  to  teach  us,  that  it  ought  to  be  repeated  before 
every  object,  which  is  exhibited  here,  and  to  manifest  his  earnest- 
ness in  forbidding  covetousness,  that  the  person  who  is  in  covenant 
with  him  may  beware  of  it  the  more.  "  Coveting."  (or  desiring) 
we  know  is  that  active  power  of  the  soul,  which  goeth  forth  with 
delight  and  inclination  to  that,  which  is  represented  by  the  under- 
standing as  good,  whether  it  be  a  real,  or  an  apparent  good  ;  for 
we  cannot  covet  aught  that  is  represented  to  us  as  evil,  but  we  have 
an  aversion  from  it.  When  now  the  Lawgiver  saith,  "  thou  shalt 
not  covet,"  he  speaks  not  then  of  a  natural  desire  to  necessary 
things  ;  for  he  himself  hath  implanted  such  a  desire  in  man  for  his 
wellbeing ;  much  less  doth  he  forbid  a  good  desire  of  his  favour  and 
fellowship,  since  he  commands  this,  Psalm  Ixxxi.  10,  and  will  ful- 
fil it,  Isaiah  Iv.  1,  but  he  forbids  a  sinful  desire. 

This  sinful  desire  (or  coveting)  is  "  the  smallest  inclination  or 
thought,  which  ariseth  in  our  hearts,  contrary  to  any  of  God's  com- 
■mandments,"  according  to  the  explanation  of  the  instructor,  and  it 
is  thus  the  beginning  of  every  sin,  which  is  forbidden  in  the  other 
commandments.  Paul  also  teaches  us  this,  when  he  saith,  that  "  he 
was  convinced  by  this  tenth  commandment  of  all  his  sins,  "  Rom. 
vii.  7,  8.  Thus  also  the  Saviour  teacheth,  that  "  looking  on  a  wo- 
man to  lust  after  her,  is  committing  adultery  with  her  in  our  heart," 
!S\d*.  v.  2;8.      Achan  was  enticed  by  hie   lust  to  steal  of  that  which 


XLIV.  LORD'S  DAY.  Q.  113—115.  377 

had  been  devoted,  Joshua  vii  21.  And  so  this  commandment  serves 
to  explain  the  foregoing-  commandments,  by  teaching  us,  that  God 
forbids  not  only  the  outward  sinful  actions,  but  even  the  desires  of 
the  soul  to  those  sins. 

But  this  commandment  doubtless  forbids  also  that  which  is  not  so 
particularly  intended  in  the  other  commands,  and  that  is  u  discon- 
tentment," whereby  a  person  craves  besides  what  he  hath  himself, 
and  with  which  he  ought  to  be  contented,  also  the  property  of 
another,  although  not  by  unrig'  teous  methods,  and  when  he  cannot 
obtain  it  so,  is  not  satisfied  }  as  Ahab  coveted  the  vineyard  of  Na- 
both,  and  was  willing  to  give  him  a  better  for  it,  or  the  value  of  it 
in  money  ;  but  upon  being  refused,  was  displeased,  1  Kings  xxi. 
1—6. 

But  let  us  view  this  covetousness,  which  hath  brought  depravity 
into  the  world,  near  at  hand,  1,  with  respect  to  its  root,  2,  with 
respect  to  its  branches  and  fruits,  and  3,  with  respect  to  the  degrees 
of  its  growth. 

The  rootsin  of  covetousness  is,  (a)  that  the  sinner  lacks  the  all- 
sufficient  God,  who  alone  can  fill  and  satisfy  the  heart  fully  :  M  He 
comes  short  of  the  glory  of  God  by  sin,"  Rom.  iii.  23,  and  "  is 
alienated  from  the  life  of  God."  Eph.  iv.  18,  whereby  his  soul,  being 
like  an  empty  vessel,  seeks  to  be  filled,  and  pants  insatiably  after  all 
that  appears  to  him  honourable,  pleasant  and  profitable,  and  so  the 
sinner  is  like  "  a  greedy  dog,  and  he  can  never  have  enough,"  as 
the  Lord  speaks  of  the  watchmen  of  his  people,  Isaiah  Jvi  11,  12. 
(b)  Covetousness  proceeds  also  from  an  irregular  selflove,  by  which 
a  person  makes  himself  the  only  object  of  whatsoever  he  doth,  and 
therefore  endeavours  to  heap  up  for  himself  whatsoever  appears  to 
him  desirable.  The  apostle  teacheth  that  those,  w  ho  are  "  lovers 
of  themselves,  are  lovers  of  pleasures  more  than  of  God."  2 
Tim.  iii.  2,  4.  (c)  This  root  comprehends  also  pride,  from  which 
ariseth  an  imagination,  that  we  deserve  more  than  we  have,  yea, 
what  our  neighbour  hath.  It  was  this  pride,  which  induced  Absa- 
lom to  covet  his  father's  kingdom,  2  Sam.  xv.  1,  6.  (d)  Eartnly- 
mindedness  excites  also  to  sinful  covetousness  ;  for  this  renders  a 
person  so  sottishly  addicted  to  "  the  lust  of  the  flesh,  the  Just  of 
the  eyes,  and  the  pride  of  life,  that  he  esteems  his  belly  his  God, 
places  his  glory  in  his  shame,  and  minds  only  earthly  things."  See 
1  John  ii.  16,  and  Philip,  iii,  19.  It  cannot  be  otherwise,  but  that 
these  roots  must  bear  many  branches  of  gall  and  wormwood.  For 
they  excite  the  desires  (a)  to  forbidden  things,  as  Eve  desired  the 
fruit  of  the  forbidden  tree,  Gen.  iii.  6.  (b)  To  indifferent  and  law- 
Vol.  ii.  2  X 


378        THE  TENTH  COMMANDMENT  EXPLAINED. 

fill  things,  but  too  immoderately  and  insatiably  ;  men  will  have  for 
instance  too  great  a  desire  to  eating  and  drinking,  like  "  the  riotous- 
eaters  of  flesh,  and  the  wine-bibbers,"  of  whom  Solomon  speaks, 
Piov.  xxiii  20  ;  too  immoderate  a  desire  to  marry,  like  Shechem, 
the  son  of  Hamor,  Gen.  xxxv.  ii — 19  ;  an  impatient  desire  for  chil- 
dren, like  Rachel,  Gen.  xxx.  1  ;  and  an  insatiable  love  of  money,  a 
desire  to  be  rich,  1  Tim.  vi.  9,  10.  (c)  From  these  evil  roots  pro- 
ceeds also  a  desire  to  good  and  divine  things  with  an  evil  end,  that 
We  may  obtain  a  name,  and  get  gain  by  them,  as  Simon  the  sor- 
cerer desired  the  gifts  of  the  Spirit,  Acts  viii.  18,  19.  See  also 
Janus  iv.   13. 

These  evil  branches  bring  forth  also  many  evil  fruits.  They  are 
the  causes  of  all  other  sins  :  "  Every  man,"  saith  James,  "  is  drawn 
away  of  his  own  lust,  and  enticed  i  hen  when  lust  hath  conceived, 
it  bringelh  foitli  sin,"  James  i.  14,  15.  1  will  mention  a  few  of 
these  bitter  fruits,  as  (a)  sinful  thoughts,  which  muse  too  long  or 
unseasonably  upon  visible  things ;  to  which  also  belongs  forming 
chimerical  schemes  or  plans  ;  for  instance,  the  fool  thinks  through 
his  covetousness,  If  1  were  but  so  wise,  or  so  rich,  or  had  such  an 
office,  then  I  would  do  this  or  that.  Or  a  person  muses  upon  sinful 
and  abominable  things,  sometimes  waking  and  sometimes  also  sleep- 
ing, suffering  "  vain  thoughts  to  lodge  within  him,"  as  the  prophet 
compkiins,  Jer.  iv.  14.  (b)  Opposing,  suppressing,  and  stifling  the 
good  mo  ions,  which  the  Holy  Spirit  excites  m  the  conscience,  that 
the  sinner  may  oppose  his  covetousness,  but  he  "quenches  the  Spi- 
rit," contrary  to  the  admonition  of  Paul,  1  Thess.  v.  19,  and  "his 
flesh  lusteth  against  the  Spirit,"  as  the  same  apostle  speaks  Gal.  v. 
17.  And  because  he  cannot  satisfy  his  lust,  by  obeying  the  Loid, 
therefore  he  resists  the  Lord  ;  for  u  the  carnal  mind  is  enmity  against 
God  :  for  it  is  not  subject  to  the  law  of  God,  neither  indeed  can  be," 
according  to  Kom.  viii.  7.  (cj  Utithankfulrtcsa  ;  doih  God  bestow 
good  things  upon  him,  he  is  not  thankful,  because  he  dotes  upon 
tiie  good  things  of  others  ;  he  murmurs  and  frets  against  the  Lord, 
because  he  may  not  have  that  which  belongeth  to  his  neighbour  : 
"These,"  saith  Jude  in  his  epistle,  vs.  16,  "are  murmurers,  com- 
plainer$,  walking  after  their  own  lusts"  (d)  It  is  also  an  evil  fruit 
of  covetousness,  that  men  are  Urged  by  it  10  grudging  and  to  other 
sordid  vices,  because  they  may  not  have  what  another  hath;  for 
"  the  works  of  the  flesh  are"  not  only  "  lasciviousness  and  idolatry," 
but  also  "  witchcraft,  hatred,  variance,  emulation,  wrath,  strife,  sedi- 
tions, envyings,  murders,"  as  the  aposde  speaks,  Gal    v.  19 — 21. 

Rut  this  covetousness  doth  hot  arrive  to  its  full  height  and  strength 
at  once,  but  grows  grauuuily. 


XLIV.  LORD'S  DAY.  Q.  1 1 3—1  is.  T9 

1.  Covetousness  is  a  habit,  and  that  foul  source,  or  inherent  cri- 
minal sin,  from  which  every  active  desire  that  is  sinful  proceeds. 
The  reason  why  ';  the  -wickedness  of  Mali  is  great  in  the  earth  i?, 
that  the  invagination  of  the  thoughts  of  his  heart  is  only  evi!  con- 
tinually," as  die  Lord  saith,  Gen.  vi.  5.  M  For  otrt  o!  ■!  ■•  he  iM  pro- 
ceed evil  thoughts,"  &c.  Matt.  xv.  19,  and  "as  a  fountain  casteth 
out  her  waters,  so  "  the  heart  "  casteth  out  its  wlc&ednessy'  Jer. 
vi.  7.  This  habitual  covetousness  is  called  by  Paul,  Rom.  vii.  17, 
18,  23,  26, "  indwelling  sin j  the  flesh,  the  law  of  sin."  That  this 
habitual  covetousness  is  also  forbidden  here  is  evident;  for  "the 
efi& of  the  commandmenl  is  charity,  out  of  a  pure  heart,"  1  Tim. 
i.  5,  and  the  law    w.  given  to  mankind,  when  they  were  perfect. 

2.  From  this  proceeds  that  first  ebullition  and  notion,  which  pro- 
vokes to  sin,  while  it  is  not  approved,  or  followed  with  a  contrivance 
to  execute  it,  yea,  is  even  resisted  and  suppressed.  The  Papists,  So- 
cinians  and  Remonstrants  deny  that  these  first  motions  of  lust  are 
sins  and  forbidden,  not  only  because  they  do  not  acknowledge  origin- 
al righteousness,  but  also  because  they  must  in  this  manner  defend 
their  vainglorious  freewill,  and  the  perfection  of  the  saints  ;  for  the^- 
see  inJeed  that  they  cannot  prevent  these  ebullitions.  But  that  theste 
first  motions  are  forbidden  is  evident,  (a)  from  this  tenth  command- 
ment, which  doth  not  limit,  but  forbiddeth  all  covetousness.  (b)  Paul 
saith,  Rom.  vii.  7,  "  I  had  not  known  lust  to  be  sin,  except  the  law 
had  said,  Thou  shalt  not  covet."  Did  not  he,  who  was  brought  urv 
at  the  feet  of  Gamaliel,  know  before  his  conversion,  that  lust  to  whiclh 
we  assent,  and  which  we  contrive  how  to  execute,  was  sin  ?  Eveu 
the  heatiiens  could  know  this.  He  speaks  then  of  those  emotions  , 
that  rise  first  of  al*.  (c)  This  covetousness  militates  against  perfec  t 
love,  and  against  the  Spirit,  according  to  Matt.  xxii.  37 — 40.  Gal 
v.  17.  (d)  according  to  the  words  of  James,  "  a  man  is  drawn> 
away  and  enticed  by  his  own  lust,  upon  which'  lust  conr.eiveth  and 
bringeth  forth  sin,"  James  i.  14,15.  What  lust  must  we  under- 
stand here,  by  that  which  draws  away,  entices  and  conaeives  but  that 
first  ebullition  which  draws  away,  entices  and  conceives  by  the  pleas- 
ure that  it  takes  in  sin,  and  in  contriving  to  execute  it  ?  It  is  true, 
this  lust  is  distinguished  from  the  sin  that  it  conceives  and  brings 
forth  ;  yet  not  in  order  to  deny  its  sinfulness,  but  to  distinguish  a 
less  from  a  greater  sin,  and  to  shew  how  a  less  sin  brings  forth  a 
greater,  as  Paul  also  saith,  that  "sin,  taking  occasion  by  the  com- 
mandment, wrought  in  him  all  manner  of  concupiscence,"  Rom.  vii. 
S.  That  which  brings  forth  sin  is  surely  sin  ;  for  like  brings  forth 
like. 

3.  From  this  foul  source,  and   from  these  sinful  ebullitions  pro- 
ceeds also  that  assent   to   lust,  by  which  we   take  a  pleasure  in  it, 


380        THE  TENTH  COMMANDMENT  EXPLAINED, 

muse  on  it  with  delight,  cherish  it,  and  suffer  ourselves  to  be  urged 
to  fulfil  it,  when  we  have  an  opportunity,  and  are  able  :  and  in  this 
manner  doth  "  lust  conceive  and  bring  forth  sin,"  James  i.   15. 

2.  When  God  forbids  a  sin,  he  then  also  commands  the  contrary 
virtue  ;  for  we  cannot  avoid  sin  except  by  pursuing  virtue,  and  there- 
fore God  commands  here, 

'  1 .  Regeneration  after  the  image  of  God,  inasmuch  as  this  restrains 
and  subdueth  the  strength  of  sinful  concupiscence.  Therefore  the 
prophet  saith,  "  Circumcise  yourselves  to  the  Lord,  and  take  away 
the  foreskins  of  your  heart,"  Jer.  iv.  4.  We  "  cast  away  our  trans- 
gressions by  making  ourselves  a  new  heart  and  a  new  spirit,"  as  we 
read,  Ezek.  xviii.  31. 

2.  Satisfaction  in  God,  whereby  all  our  desires,  being  filled  with 
him;  are  listless  towards  sin  :  "  Whom  have  I  in  heaven  but  thee  ? 
and  there  is  none  upon  earth  that  I  desire  besides  thee,"  saith 
Asaph  to  the  Lord,  Psalm  lxxiii.  25.  So  llabakkuk  also  expresseth 
himself  in  his  prophecy,  ch.  iii    17,   18. 

3.  Contentment  with  that  portion  of  earthly  goods,  which  God 
bestows  on  us.  Paul  "  having  learned  in  whatsoever  state  he  was, 
•therewith  to  he  content,"  Philip,  iv.  11,  exhorts  others  also  "  to  be 
content  with  such  things  as  they  have,"  Heb.  xiii.  5. 

'4,  Joy  and  pleasure  in  our  neighbour's  welfare,  so  that'  we  "  re- 
joice with  them  who  do  rejoice,"  Rom.  xii.    15. 

5.  Hatred  and  opposition  to  all  that  is  sinful,  by  which  we  en- 
.deavour  to  subdue  and  mortify  all  our  lusts,  according  to  the  admo- 
nition of  the  apostle,  Col.  iii.  5,  for  thus  "  we  abstain  from  fleshly 
lusts,  which  war  against  the  soul,"  as  Peter  requireth,  1  Peter  ii.  11. 

6.  An  insatiable  desire,  and  active  inclination  to  all  righteousness, 
-by  which,  with  David  and  Paul,  "  we  delight  in  the  law  and  com- 
mandments of  God,  afteV  the  inner  man,"  Psalm  cxix.  47,  131. 
Rom.  vii.  22. 

3.  The  sinful  heart  will  not  submit  to  such  a  restraint,  it  imagines 
that  this  would  be  unreasonable.  But  this  "  commandment  is  holy, 
just  and  good,"  as  Paul  said  of  it,  when  he  saw  himself  condemned 
by  it,  Rom.  vii.  12.  For  (a)  covetousness  militates  against  the  sove- 
reignty of  God  over  the  heart.  Therefore  he  also  mark*  it  strictly, 
»nd  will  judge  it,  according  to  Jer.  xvii.  9,  10.  Rom.  ii.  16,  and 
f-quires  that  the  pet  son,  who  is  in  covenant  with  him,  should  be 
,  as  the  Lord  his  God  is  holy,  Lev.  xix.  2.  We  must  there- 
fore "  put  off  the  old  man,  which  is  corrupt  according  to  the  deceit- 
ful lusts  :  and  be  renewed  in  the  spirit  of  our  minds;  and  put  on 
the  new  man,  which  after  God  is  created  in   righteousness  and  true 


XL1V.  LORD'S  DAY.  Q.  113—115.  381 

holiness,"  Eph,  iv.  22 — 24  Yea,  covetousness  militates  also  against 
the  providence  of  God,  who  gives  to  every  man  as  much  as  he  plea- 
seth.  Therefore  when  God  bestows  any  good  thing  upon  our 
neighbour,  and  withholds  it  from  us,  "  shall  our  eye  be  evil,  because 
God  is  good,"  as  the  Saviour  asks,  disapproving  of  such  a  temper, 
Malt.  xx.  15.  (b)  It  is  also  vaniiy  to  be  so  intent  upon  earthly 
matteis  ;  for  it  is  vain  to  rise  up  early,  to  sit  up  late,  and  to  eat  the 
bread  of  sorrow  :  for  so  he  giveth  his  beloved  sleep,"  Psalm  cxxvii. 
2.  Neither  can  the  capacious  soul  be  satisfied  with  all  these  visible 
things  ;  the  round  world  cannot  fill  the  triangular  heart :  "  The  eye 
is  not  satisfied  with  seeing,  nor  the  ear  filled  with  hearing,"  saith 
the  wise  king,  Eccl.  i.  8.  God  alone  is  able  to  fill  the  rational  soul, 
and  to  afford  her  a  satisfying  pleasure  with  his  allsufficiency.  See 
2  Cor.  ix.  8. 

II  We  have  thus  explained  the  whole  law :  but  we  do  still  not 
understand  it,  if  we  do  not  rightly  comprehend  the  end,  for  which 
the  law  was  given.  To  what  purpose  then  is  the  law  ?  To  teach 
us  that  man  can  keep  it  perfectly,  after  it  is  once  become  weak 
through  the  flesh  I  Paul  denies  this,  when  he  saith,  Gal.  iii.  21, 
11  If  there  had  been  a  law  given,  which  could  have  given  life,  verily 
righteousness  should  have  been  by  the  law."  To  explain  this  more 
particularly,  we  will,  with  the  instructor,  inquire,  (1)  whether  those 
who  are  converted  to  God  can  keep  the  law  perfectly,  and  if  not,  (2) 
why  God  suffers  it  to  be  preached  to  us  so  strictly. 

We  presuppose  that  man,  before  the  fall  was  both  obliged,  and 
able  to  keep  the  law,  in  order  to  obtain  life  by  his  own  righteous- 
ness ;  that  since  the  fall,  and  since  the  upraising  of  the  elect  sinner, 
man  is  still  obliged  to  keep  the  law  perfectly  ;  for  he  should  other- 
wise not  sin  any  more  :  neither  can  he  ever  be  discharged  from  a 
perfect  obligation  to  the  Supreme  Ruler,  because  as  long  as  he  is 
a  creature,  and  the  Lord  is  God,  so  long  he  is  in  every  respect  sub- 
ject to  God.  We  maintain  also  that  the  sinner,  while  in  the  state  of 
nature,  is  wholly  unable  to  do  aught  that  is  good,  as  we  have  shown 
on  the  eighth  and  ninth  questions.  But  the  subject  of  our  present 
inquiry  is,  whether  those  who  are  converted  to  God  can  keep  the 
law  perfectly.  We  allow  that  believers  possess,  in  consequence  of 
their  new  birth,  a  certain  ability  for  that  which  is  good.  We  also 
acknowledge  that  they  possess  a  certain  perfection,  not  only  with  re- 
spect to  justification,  by  which  <l  they  are  perfect  in  Christ,"  as 
Paul  saith,  Col.  ii.  10,  but  also  with  respect  to  sanctification,  even  a 
perfection  of  sincerity,  and  of  parts,  of  soul  and  body,  a  perfect  heart 
and  "  a  sincere  resolution  to  live,  not  only  according  to  some,  but 


382       THE  TENTH  COMMANDMENT  EXPLAINED. 

according  to  all  the  commands  of  God,"  as  David  and  Hezekiah  tes- 
tify concerning   themselves,    Psalm  cxix.   128.     Isaiah  xxxviii.  3. 
Moreover,  one  believer  is  said  to    be  more  perfect   than  another,  on 
account  of  his  greater  proficiency  :  "  Strong   meat     belongeth    to 
them  who  are  perfect,"*  Heb.  v.   14.     But  the  question  is,  whether 
a  believer  can  in  this  present  life  be  perfect,  with  respect  to  degrees, 
and  thus  be  wholly  sinless.     This  is  the  doctrine  of  the  Papists,  So- 
cinians  and  Remonstrants.     They  cannot  otherwise  maintain   the 
doctrine  of  their  indifferent  freewill.     Yea,  the  Papists  conceive  that 
they  can  be  more  than   perfect  by  their  works  of  supererogation  : 
and  the  Socinians  think  that  tney  can  be  more  perfect  than  the  law 
of  Moses  required,  because  they  must  now  live  according  to  the  im- 
proved law  of  Christ ;  but  we  deny  such  a  perfection   of  the   saints. 
It  those  persons,  who  boast  so  much  of  their  perfection,    knew    the 
unspotted  holiness  of   God,  and  the   spirituality  of  the  law,  and   if 
they  were  only  experimentally  convinced  with  Paul  by  the  tenth  com- 
mandment, "  that  lust  is  sin,"  they  would  assent  to   the   doctrine, 
that  the  saints  cannot  be  perfect  in  this  life.     They   ought   at    least 
to  have    learned    better   from    the    word    of  God :    for  that  saith, 
(I)  That  all  men,  and   therefore  those   also,  who   are  converted    to 
God,  have  sins  :  "  There  is  no    man  who    sinneth   not,"  saith    wise 
Solomon,  1  Kings  viii.  46.     Prov   xx.  9.     Eccl.  vii.  20.   "  In  many 
things  we  offend  all,"  saith  James  in  his    epistle,  chap.  iii.  2,   and 
John  saith,  "  If  we  say  that   we   have  no  sin.  we   deceive  ourselves, 
and  the  truth  is  net  in  us,"    1  John  i.  8.      The    most   holy    persons 
also  acknowledge,  that  they   are  guilty  of  sin  ;  see  this  in  that  most 
upright  man   Job.  chap.  ix.  2,  3 — in  the  man  after  God's  own  heart, 
Psalm  xix.  12.     exxx.  3.     cxliii.  2,  and  in  that  highly   enlightened 
apostle,  Philip,  iii.  12.     (2)  "  The  holiest  men   have  but   small  be- 
ginnings of  this  perfect  obedience."     Paul   and   other    great   saints 
"  knew  and  prophesied   but   in  part,"   1  Cor.  xiii.  9,  10.       He   and 
the  holy  Romans    bad   only  "the    first-fruits  of  the   Spirit,"  Rom. 
■viii.  23.     Now  we  know  what  a  small  beginning  of  the    harvest  the 
first-fruits  are.     (3)  The   most  that  the  saints   have  is,  that  "with  a 
sincere  resolution  they  begin  to  live  not  only  according  to  some,  but 
according  to  all  the  commandments  of  God."     See  David's  longing 
Psalm  cxix.  5,  and    Paul's  panting  after  perfection,    Philip,   iii.   12, 
15.     "  To  will  is  present  with  me,  but  how  to  perform  that  which  is 
good,  I  find  not,"  Rom.  vii.  18.     And  what    hindereth    them  from 
being  perfect  in/tins  life  ?  is  it  not  their  remaining  corruptions   and 

•  This  is  aj-reeablc  to  the  Dutch  translation. 


XLIV.  LORD'S  DAY".  Q.   113—115.  333 

iusis,  that  "when  they  would  do  good,  evil  is  present  with  them, 
and  they  are  brought  into  captivity  to  the  law  of  sin,  which  is  in  their 
members,"  Rom.  vii.  21,  23.  See  how  the  same  Paul  speaks,  GaL 
v.   17. 

When  it  is  said,  that  the  most  holy  persons,  who  have  made  a 
greater  proficiency  than  others,  "  have  only  small  beginnings  of 
obedience  to  God,"  it  cloth  not  follow  therelrom,  that  those  who  are 
least  holy,  and  are  nevertheless  truly  converted,  have  nothing  at  all  of 
this  obedience ;  for  the  most  holy,  when  they  are  compared  with 
the  perfect  demand  of  God's  law,  and  the  state  of  perfection  after 
this  life,  cannot  have  more  than  such  small  beginnings  ;  but  if  we 
compare  them  with  those,  who  have  made  the  least  proficiency,  then 
they  are,  as  it  were,  perfect,  and  those  least  holy  persons  are  like 
children,  who  are  yet  busy  with  first  principles,  according  to  Jtleb* 
v.  12—  14. 

We  read  indeed  often  of  the  saints,  that  "  they  walk  with  a  per- 
fect heart  in  all  the  commandments  of  the  Lord  blameless,"  as  it  is 
said  of  David,  1  Kings  ix.  4.  xiv  8.  Acts  xiii.  22,  and  of  Heze- 
kiah,  2  Kings  xviii  6,  and  of  Zacharias,  Luke  i.  6.  But  the  sins 
of  those  saints  are  too  well  known  that  we  should  conclude  there- 
from, that  they  had  attained  to  a  perfection  of  degrees.  These 
phrases  only  intimate  that  they  possessed  a  perfection  of  parts,  which 
doth  not  exclude  their  stumblings.  Though  "  Asa  took  not  away 
the  high  places,  and  was  guilty  of  other  sins,  nevertheless  the  heart 
of  Asa  was  perfect  all  his  days,"  2  Chron.  xv.  17.     xvi.  2 — 12. 

"  Why  then  will  God  have  the  ten  commandments  so  strictly 
preached,  since  no  man  in  this  life  can  keep  them  *"  Thus  asks 
the  instructor  from  the  mouth  of  our  adversaries,  who  assert  that 
the  strict  preaching  of  the  law  is  an  evidence,  that  we  can  keep  it 
perfectly.  Before  we  remove  this  difficulty,  we  say  that  the  strict 
pieaching  of  the  law  doth  not  consist  in  urging  it  as  the  condition 
of  the  covenant  of  works,  that  we  may  seek  life  by  it,  or  as  a  spe- 
cial ministration  of  the  Old  Testament  ;  for  in  this  respect  believ- 
ers are  "  no  longer  under  the  law,"  Rom.  vi.  14.  Gal  iii.  25,  and 
in  this  respect  Christ  hath  fulfilled  it  for  them,  Rom.  viii.  3,  4,  but 
in  seriously  exhibiting  it,  as  an  everlasting  rule  of  obedience,  in  all 
its  extent,  obligations,  threatenings  and  promises.  We  may  not 
preach  the  law  thus,  say  the  Antinomians.  But  Christ  and  his 
apostles  preached  it  in  this  strict  manner.  Paul  requires  that  Titus 
should  "rebuke  sharply  and  with  all  authority,"  Titus  i.  13.  ii.  15. 
We  are,  and  always  will  remain  obligated  to  obey  God,  on  account 
of  his  sovereignty,  and  this  everlasting  obligation  is  rendered   still 


884        THE  TENTH  COMMANDMENT  EXPLAINED. 

Stronger  by  grace  :  "Christ,"  saith  the  apostle,  Titus  ii.  14,  "gave 
himself  for  us,  that  he  might  redeem  us  from  all  iniquity,  and  pu- 
rify unto  himself  a  peculiar  people,  zealous  of  good  works."  Ought 
not  this  obligation  then  to  be  urged,  and  therefore  strictly  preached  ? 
But  if  the  law  must  be  preached  so  strictly,  we  must  then  be 
able  to  keep  it  perfectly,  otherwise  it  will  be  in  vain  to  preach  it  so 
strictly,  say  the  patrons  of  the  perfection  of  the  saints.  But  no  duty 
declares  what  we  can,  but  what  we  ought  to  do,  as  we  have  shown 
upon  the  eighth  and  ninth  question.  And  though  God  doth  not 
require  that  the  law  should  be  preached  strictly,  because  we  can 
keep  it,  yet  there  are  other  reasons  for  this.  It  is  proper  to  preach 
it  strictly,  in  order  to  condemn  and  restrain  the  reprobates  ;  "  for 
whose  sake  the  law  was  given,"  according  to  1  Tim.  i.  9,  10,  and  to 
convince  the  elect  before  they  are  converted  in  order  to  their  conver- 
sion, and  to  urge  them  to  the  Mediator,  Rom.  iii.  20.  x.  4.  But  besides 
this,  the  strict  preachingof  the  law  is  serviceable  to  believers,  (a)  "  That 
all  their  lifetime  they  may  learn  more  and  more  to  know  their  sinful 
nature."  For  they  are  by  this  mean  humbled,  and  rendered  capable  of 
more  grace,  as  the  heart  of  Josiah  became  "  tender,"  when  the  law  was 
read  to  him,  2  Kings  xxti.  11—22.  (b) "  That  they  may  thus  be- 
come the  more  earnest  in  seeking  the  remission  of  sins,  and  righ- 
teousness in  Christ."  For  the  law  teafcfteth  them  the  necessity  of 
remission,  anJ  the  gospel  revealing  Christ  to  them,  they  are  urged 
to  him.  Paul,  convinced  of  his  condition  by  the  law,  cried  out  for 
deliverance  through  Christ,  Rem.  vii.  24.  D  •  d  did  this  before 
him,  Psalm  xxxii,  li.  (c)  "  That  they  may  constantly  endeavour 
and  pray  to  God  for  his  grace,"  &c.  The  law,  when  it  is  preached 
strictly,  exhibits  perfect  holiness  in  all  its  lustre,  and  believers  being 
in  consequence  of  this,  smitten  with  the  love  of  it,  "  press  after  per- 
fection," with  Paul,  Philip,  iii.  12,  13,  and  pray  earnestly  for  the 
grace  of  God,  that  he  would  cause  thertl  to  keep  his  law.  Hear 
what  the  great  lover  of  the  law  saith  to  the  Lord.  Psalm  cxix.  4,  5. 
"  Thou  hast  commanded  me  to  keep  thy  precepts  diligently.  O 
that  my  ways  were  directed  to  keep  thy  statutes."  We  might  as- 
sign other  reasons  for  preaching  the  law  strictly  to  believers,  as,  that 
they  may  thus  see  what  Chvis*.  hath  done  for  them  ;  that  the  law 
is  a  rule  of  thankfulness  to  them,  who  are  God's  covenant  peoples 
and  that  the  law  is  to  them  an  evidence  of  the  grace  of  God,  since' 
they  have  the  law  in  their  hearts,  and  they  delight  in  it,  and  observ? 
it:  but  we  may  not  insist  too  long  on  these  thing 


XLIV.  LORD'S  DAY.  Q.  113—115.  385 


APPLICATION. 

So  long,  hearers,  have  ye  heard  the  strict  preaching  of  the  law. 
But  hath  it  answered  these  good  purposes  with  you  ?  burely  many 
of  you  have  not  yet  been  properly  advantaged  by  it.  It  is  evi- 
dent ;  for 

1.  The  most  of  you  know  not  yet  their  sinful  nature.  Some 
know  indeed  that  they  have  sinned  ;  but  do  ye  indeed  see  that  your 
very  nature  is  sinful,  that  ye  are  thoroughly  leavened  with  sin,  and 
that  it  is  become,  as  it  were,  your  second  nature  to  sin  ?  no,  ye  do 
not  know  your  sinful  lusting  ;  ye  think  that  if  ye  do  not  render 
yourselves  guilty  of  gross  sins,  ye  are  already  very  virtuous  ;  ye 
know  not  with  an  inward,  experimental  knowledge,  that  lust  is  sinful 
in  you,  although  the  law  saith,  "  Thou  shalt  not  covet,"  and  ye 
dare  think,  yea,  even  say,  that  ye  are  not  covetous,  but  content  with 
your  own.  Why  should  we  wonder,  for  ye  never  come  to  your- 
selves, and  do  not  look  to  the  bottom  of  your  corrupt  hearts,  and 
thus  "  do  not  know  the  plague  of  your  hearts,"  as  is  required,  1 
Kings  viii.  38. 

2.  Many  sin  and  are  careless,  from  an  observation  of  the  imper- 
fections of  the  saints.  What  thinkest  thou,  O  sinner,  when  thy 
lust  enticeth  thee  to  this  and  that  sin,  dost  thou  not  then  venture  to 
commit  it,  because  the  saints  defiled  themselves  with  such  sins  ? 
and  when  thy  conscience  reproves  thee  on  account  of  thine  abomi- 
nations, dost  thou  not  then  flatter  thyself  that,  since  the  saints  obtain- 
ed the  forgiveness  of  their  sins,  thou  also  wilt  obtain  forgiveness  ? 
but  do  thy  sins  distress  thee  as  much  as  the  sins  of  the  saints  dis- 
tressed them  ?  and  cio  they  cause  thee  to  seek  with  such  earnestness, 
forgiveness  and  righteousness  in  Christ,  and  to  fight  and  guard  more 
earnestly  through  the  grace  of  the  Lord  against  sin,  as  the  sins  of 
the  saints  constrained  them  to  do  ?  See  this  in  David  and  Josiah, 
Psalm  li.  2  Chron.  xxxiv.  19 — 27.  And  it  is  still  baser,  that  many 
of  you  watch  for  the  failings  of  the  saints,  in  order  to  scoff  at  them, 
and  to  reproach  them  on  account  of  their  failings,  with  much  sar- 
castic bitterness,  both  in  their  presence  and  absence  :  "  men  watch 
for  their  halting,"  as  the  prophet  complains,  Jer.  xx.  10,  "  and 
when  they  halt,  rejoice,"  as  David  experienced  to  his  sorrow,  Psalm 
xxxv.  15.  But  if  ye  knew  their  distress  on  account  of  their  hailing, 
ye  would  not  add  to  their  sorrow.  David  had  therefore  reason  to 
say  to  the  Lord,  Psalm  xxxviii.  16,  17.  "Lest  they  should  rejoice 
over  me  :  when  my  foot  slippeth,  they  magnify  themselves  against

me.  For  I  am  ready  to  halt,  and  my  sorrow  is  continually  be- 
fore me." 

3.  There  are  few  who  make  a  right  use  of  the  preaching  of  the 
law  ;  for  some  cannot  and  will  not  hear  the  strict  preaching  of  the 
law,  they  cannot  endure  that  probing  of  their  hearts,  and  it  provokes 
them  to  indignation  against  the  preacher  of  the  law.  Is  it  not  tiue  ? 
will  ye  not  hate  him,  speak  evil  of  him,  depart  from  him,  and 
turn  away  your  ears,  while  he  preaches,  from  hearing  the  law  ?  The 
surly  temper  of  God's  ancient  people  prevails  also  in  many  of  you. 
See  this  wickedness  detected  and  threatened,  Isaiah  xxx.  9 — 14. 
lix.  Amos  v.  10.  Others  are  better  pleased  with  the  preaching  of 
the  law  :  they  hear  willingly  a  wise  reprover,  and  even  say  that  he 
cannot  preach  too  sharply  ;  but  they  do  not  proceed  any  further. 
Some  of  you  are  indeed  at  times  alarmed,  and  are  afraid  with  Felix  ; 
but  ye  seek  to  divert  it,  as  he  did,  Acts  xxiv.  25,  or  are  with 
"  Agrippa  almost  persuaded  to  become  Christians,"  Acts  xxvi.  28, 
but  this  is  all  that  comes  of  it  ;  and  If  it  produce  any  effect,  it  will 
not  induce  you  to  seek  with  restlessness,  pardon  and  righteousness 
in  Christ ;  this  ye  neglect ;  but  endeavour  to  amend  in  some  meas- 
ure your  evil  doings ;  and  when  ye  advance  a  little  therein,  ye 
think  that  God  will  overlook  all  your  shortcomings,  as  weaknesses  : 
and  ye  have  thus,  like  the  Jews,  "  a  zeal  for  God  ;  but  not  according 
to  knowledge  :  for  ye  are  ignorant  of  God's  righteousness,  and  go 
about  to  establish  your  own  righteousness  ;  and  do  not  thus  submit 
yourselves  to  the  righteousness  of  God,"  Rom.  x.  2,  3.  For  ye 
seek  not  your  salvation  and  rest  in  "Christ,  who  is  the  end  of  the 
law  for  righteousness  to  every  one  that  believeth,"  vs.  4,  but  in  your 
own  doings. 

Therefore  all  that  ye  have  heard  so  long  a  time,  of  the  law,  hath 
been  unprofitable,  and  of  no  service  tojou.  And  consequently  the 
whole  law,  with  ail  its  commands  and  threatenings,  is  yet  against 
you,  and  ye  lie  under  the  ciKse  of  the  law,  which  is  denounced 
against  the  transgressors,  Gal.'iii.  10,  12,  and  ye  never  will,  while 
yc  remain  in  your  present  condition,  surmount  it ;  "  for  God  will 
by  no  means  clear  the  gu  ity."  Exod.  xxxiv.  7,  and  ye  arc  guilty 
before  him.  Will  ye  flee  bom  the  wrath  to  come,  flee  then  to  the 
Son  of  God,  in  order  to  obt  tin  in  him  grace  and  mercy  of  the  Lord ; 
«  for  Christ  is  the  end  of  the  law  lb.-  righteousness  to  every  one  that 
believeth/'  Rom.  x 

But  ye,  O  bel  vers  nrtist  also  still  make  use  of  the  law,  though 
yea'-e  not  any  longer  under  the  law,  but  under  grace,  and  the  right- 
eousness of  U*e  law   is  i'uifuUu   ui   yuu  tlnough  the  satisfaction  of 


XLIV.  LORD'S  DAY.  Q.  1 1C — \15.  387 

Christ ;    for   the   law  must   yet   be   strictly   preached  to  you  also. 
Tli  ere  fore, 

1.  Exercise  yourselves  yet  daily  in  seeking  a  knowledge  of  your 
sins,  that  ye  may  become  more  and  more  acquainted  with  your  sin- 
ful nature.  When  God  began  to  lay  his  good  hand  on  you,  in  order 
to  convert  you,  he  discovered  to  you  indeed  your  abominableness 
and  guilt,  yet  he  discovered  it  only  in  part  ;  but  now  ye  must  behold 
still  greater  abominations.  Therefore  examine  yourselves  olten  by 
the  law,  and  compare  yourselves  with  all  that  is  commanded  and 
forbidden  in  it ;  give  strict  heed  to  your  heart,  and  observe  what  en- 
ters in,  and  what  goeth  out  of  it,  and  whither  it  would  mislead  you, 
if  the  Lord  did  not  restrain  you  by  his  grace,  yea,  how  often  it  actu- 
ally seduces  you,  against  your  sine,  re  and  determined  resolution, 
Descend  often  into  yourselves,  that  ye  may  see  that  filthy  bottom, 
and  your  concupiscence,  as  the  first  headspring  of  your  sinful  nature, 
and  how  that  sinful  nature  becomes  active,  when  the  hatefulness  of 
sin  is  exhibited  by  a  prohibition  of  it.  Paul  learned  to  know  his  sin- 
ful nature  in  this  manner  ;  for  he  saith,  Rom.  vii.  8  11,13.  u  Sin, 
taking  occasion  by  the  commandment,  wrought  in  me  all  manner  of 
concupiscence,  deceived  me,  and  by  it  slew  me.  Was  then  that 
■Which  is  good  made  death  unto  me  ?  God  forbid.  But  sin  was  made 
death  to  me,  that  it  might  appear  sin,  working  death  in  me  by  that 
which  is  good ;  that  sin  by  the  commandment  might  become  ex- 
ceeding sinful." 

2.  Beware  that  your  sight  of  your  sinful  nature,  and  your  sorrow 
for  it  do  not  render  you  impatient,  and  fretful  and  that  it  do  not 
discourage  you.  It  hath  pleased  the  Lord  to  lea\e  these  corruptions, 
as  thorns  in  your  eyes,  and  as  goads  in  your  sides,  in  order  to  hum- 
ble you,  that  ye  may  not  be  exalted  on  account  of  the  excellency  of 
the  revelation  ;  that  Christ  may  remain  precious  to  you,  and  that  he 
may  induce  you  to  seek  his  righteousness  continually  ;  and  also  that 
he  may  cause  you  to  be  to  the  glory  of  his  wisdom,  power  and  good- 
ness, since  he  is  able  to  lead  you  in  such  a  sinful  way  to  salvation. 
He  chooses  to  render  you  earnestly  desirous  of  th«  perfect  state  in 
heaven  ;  also  to  retain  you  in  a  state  of  warfare,  that  he  may  render 
you  conquerors,  and  may  crown  you  after  your  work  is  finished. 
Exercise  yourselves  then  in  these  things,  and  continue  engaged  in 
them. 

3.  Beware  of  reproaching  and  despising  others,  who  are  beset 
with  infirmities,  on  account  of  their  stumblings.  Ye  know  how 
your  own  sins  grieve  you  ;  think  not  that  other  godly  persons  take 
pleasure  in  theirs :  "  Brethren,"  saith  the  apostle,  Gal.  vi.  1,  "  if  a 


388       THE  TENTH  COMMANDMENT  EXPLAINED. 

man  be  overtaken  in  a  fault,  ye  which  are  spiritual,  restore  such  an 
one  in  the  spirit  of  meekness  j  considering  thyself,  lest  thou  also 
be  tempted." 

4.  Pursue  after  perfection,  though  ye  cannot  be  perfect.  To  in- 
dulge without  restraint  in  sin,  or  to  be  discouraged,  because  we  can- 
not attain  to  perfection  is  not  the  conduct  of  tender  Christians  ;  for 
they  rather  "reach  forth  to  it,"  with  Paul,  Philip  iii.  12 — u.  If 
we  will  be  in  earnest,  we  will  attain  to  perfection  after  this  life,  yea, 
in  this  life  we  may  always  become  more  perfect  than  we  are. 

5.  Every  believer  should  endeavour  to  labour  and  advance  accord- 
ing  to  his  proficiency.  As  the  man  is,  so  is  his  strength.  A  child, 
a  youth,  and  a  man  in  Christ  must  each  conduct  according  to,  and 
not  above  his  strength,  that  he  may  not  overtoil  himself.  This  the 
apostle  requireth,   Philip,  iii.  15,  16. 

Thus  the  law  will  not  be  a  terror  to  ycu  :  "  The  law  is  not  against 
such  persons,  and  it  was  not  made  fur  righteous  persons,"  as  the 
apostle  saith,  Gal.  v.  23.  1  Tim.  i.  9.  Your  endeavours  and  imper- 
fect obedience,  O  believers,  will  still  be  acceptable  to  God  :  "  For 
if  there  be  first  a  willing  mind,  it  is  accepted,  according  to  that  a 
man  hath,  and  not  according  to  that  he  hath  not,"  saith  Paul,  2 
Cor.  viii  12.  Having  such  a  perfect  heart,  ye  will  be  imboldened  to 
say  with  Heztkiah  to  the  Lord  in  the  hour  of  death,  "  Remember 
now.  O  Lord,  I  beseech  thee,  how  I  have  walked  before  thee  in 
truth,  and  with  a  perfect  heart,  and  have  done  that  which  is  good  in 
thy  sight,"  Isaiah  xxxviii.  3.  It  is  true,  your  lusts  and  imperfec- 
tions do  still  afflict  you,  but  they  will  soon  be  abolished,  and  your 
Head  and  Husband  Christ,  "  will  present  you  to  himself  a  glorious 
church,  not  having  spot,  or  wrinkle,  or  any  such  thing ;  but  holy 
and  without  blemish."  Thus  speaks  Paul,  Eph.  v.  27.  "  And  let 
all  the  people  say  Amen,  yea,  Amen,"
