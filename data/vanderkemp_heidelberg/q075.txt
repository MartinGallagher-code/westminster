Q.   75.  Horn  art  thou  admonished  and  assured  in  the  Lord's  Sufifiert 
that  thou  art  a  partaker  •/   that  one  sacrifice  of  Chri*t,  accomplished  or. 
the  cross    end  of  all  his  benefits  ? 

A.  Thus,  that  Christ  has  commanded  me  and  all  believers  to  eat 
of  this  broken  bread,  and  to  drink  of  this  cup  in  remembrance  of 
him  ;  adding  these  promises  •  first,  that  his  body  was  offered  and 
broken  on  the  cross  for  me,  and  his  blood  shed  for  me,  as  certainly 
as  1  see  with  my  eyes,  the  bread  of  the  Lord  broken  for  me,  and  the 


—77.  77 

cup  communicated  to  me  :  and  further,  that  he  feeds  and  nourishes 
my  soul  to  everlasting  life,  with  his  crucified  body  and  shed  blood, 
as  assuredly  as  I  receive  from  the  lands  of  the  minister,  and  taste 
with  my  mouth  the  bread  and  cup  of  the  Lord,  as  certain  signs  of 
the  body  and  blood  of  Christ. 

Q.  76.    What  is  it  then  to  eat  the  crucified  body,  a;ul  drink  the  shed 
blood  of  Christ  ? 

A.  Jt  is  not  only  to  embrace  with  a  believing  heart  all  the  suffer- 
ings and  death  of  Christ,  and  thereby  to  obtain  the  pardon  of  sin,  and 
life  eternal ;  but  also,  besides  that,  to  become  more  and  more  united 
to  his  sacred  body  by  the  Holy  Ghost,  who  dwells  both  in  Christ 
and  in  us  ;  so  that  we,  though  Christ  is  in  heaven,  and  we  on  earth 
are  notwithstanding,  "  Flesh  of  his  flesh,  and  bone  of  his  bone  ;"  and 
that  we  live  and  are  governed  for  ever  by  one  Spirit,  as  members  of 
the  same  body  are  by  one  soul. 

Q.  77.    Where  has  Chris!  promised,  that  he  will  as  certainly  feed 
nourish  believers  with  his  body  and  blood,  as  they  eat  of  this  broken  bread 
and  di  ink  of  this  cup.  ? 

A.  In  the  institution  of  the  supper,  which  is  thus  expressed  : 
"  The  Lord  Jesus  in  the  same  night  in  which  he  was  betrayed,  took 
bread,  and  when  he  had  given  thanks,  he  brake  it,  and  said,  v,ke, 
eat ;  this  is  my  body,  which  is  broken  for  you  ;  this  do  in  remem- 
brance of  me  :  after  the  same  manner  also  he  took  the  cup,  when  he 
had  supped,  saying,  this  cup  is  the  New  Testament  in  Bay  blood  ; 
this  do  ye  as  often  as  ye  drink  it  in  remembrance  of  me.  For  as  often 
as  ye  eat  tins  bread,  and  drink  this  cup,  ye  do  show  the  Lord's  death 
till  he  come." 

This  promise  is  repeated  by  the  holy  apostle  Paul,  where  he 
says,  "the  cup  of  blessing  which  we  bless,  is  it  not  the  communion 
of  the  blood  of  Christ  ?  The  bread  which  we  break,  is  it  not  the 
communion  of  the  body  of  Christ  ?  For  we  being  many,  are  one 
bread  and  one  body;  because  we  are  all  partakers  of  that  one 
bread." 


>  S  it  is  necessary  that  a  man  should  be  born,  in  order  that  hq 
m  y  exist,  so  it  is  also  necessary  that  he  should  be  daily  nourished, 
that  he  may  continue  in  existence.  No  man  exists  necessarily  nor 
from  eternity,  nor  of  himself  by  his  essence  ;  he  must  have  his  be- 
ginning from  another,  which  he  obtains  by  his  birth.  Thus  also  he 
cannot  continue  in  existt  nee  of  himself,  nor  cause  himself  to  exist  in 
future  j  a  higher  efficient  than  himself  must  cause  him  to  exist  in  fu- 


78  THE  NATURE  OF  THE  LORD'S  SUPPER 

ture  ;  if  he  shall  continue  to  exist.  It  is  God  indeed  who  "  pre 
serves  man  and  beast,"  as  David  saith,  Psalm  xxxvi.  6.  The  Lord 
could  indeed  do  this  immediately,  but  it  pleased]  him  of  his  good- 
ness to  do  it  by  means,  and  by  daily  food :  man  hath  t;;us  time 
after  time  a  new  refreshment,  and  a  repeated  experience  of  the  kind- 
ness of  God. 

This  is  necessary  for  the  body  ;  but  as  the  soul,  alienated  from 
the  life  of  God,  cannot  live,  unless  she  be  born  again,  so  she  cannot 
remain  alive  unless  she  continually  receive  spiritual  food  :  therefore 
the  Lord,  willing  to  finish  the  good  work  which  is  begun  in  her, 
affords  her  also  daily  food  :  he  promiseth  her  that  he  "  will  guide 
her  continually  and  satisfy  her,"  Isaiah  Iviii.  11.  To  this  end  he 
gives  her  not  only  the  good  things  of  his  covenant,  "  satisfies  her 
with  the  goodness  of  his  house,  even  of  his  holy  temple,"  as  David 
trusted  that  he  would  do,  Psalm  lxv.  4,  causes  her  "to  cat  that 
[  which  is  good,  to  delight  herself  in  fatness,"  as  he  offers  her,  Isa,  lv.  2, 
that  he  may  "  strengthen  the  heart  with  grace,"  according  to  Heb. 
xiii.  9,  but  he  gives  her  also  his  word,  and  the  sacrament  of  the  sup- 
per, by  which  that  delicious  food  is  served  up  to  her,  and  received 
by  her  in  its  proper  savour  and  reiis\  ;  for  k'the  cup  is  the  commun- 
ion of  the  blood  of  Christ,  an  dthe  bread  is  the  communion  of  his 
body,"  as  Paul  speaks,  1  Cor.  x.  1ft.  By  which  he  therefore  en- 
joins on  us  to  eat  his  body,  and  drink  his  blood,  as  that  faithful  man 
delivers  in  the  text,  agreeably  to  the  institution  of  Christ.  We 
have  seen  on  a  former  occasion  how  the  Lord  seals  regeneration  to 
his  people,  «'e  must  now  show  how  he  nourishes  them  by  the 
seal  of  the  supper. 

This  is  an  important  doctrine,  and  it  is  therefore  considered  with 
exactnes  by  the  instructor,  in  four  particulars  : 

I.  He  explains  the  proper  nature  of  the  supper  in  this  Lord's 
day. 

II.  He  refutes  the  errour  of  transubslantiation  and  of  the  mass-
