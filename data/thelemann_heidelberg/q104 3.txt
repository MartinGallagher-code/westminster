That I show all honor, love and fidelity to my father and mother,, and all in authority over me, and submit raybelf to their good instruction and correction with due obedience ; and also patiently bear with their weakness and infirmities, since it pleases God to govern us by their hand.

I. THE DUTIES OF SUBJECTS TO SUPERIORS. A. Duties of Children to Parents.

1. The fifth commandment, with which the *' second table" of the law begins, treats in the first place of the duties of children to their parents (" father and mother" are mentioned), and all who stand in the same relation as these to children, such as grand-parents, step-parents and adojDted parents, older relations and guardians.

2. To them is to be shown :

a) "All honor." This consists in heartily esteeming parents, and manifesting such esteem outwardly in acts of respect. Ex. 21 : 15, 17. Modesty and respect are due from youths to all older people. Lev. 19 : 32.

h) "All love," i. e., hearty affection and attachment. This manifests itself in an obliging disposition, which prompts children to do any favors for their parents which they know would please them, in praying for them and in not allowing any one to alienate them from, nor to incite them against their parents. Matt. 10 : 37. From this passage it will be seen that children are to love their parents more than all others, and that this love is inferior only to that due to the Lord.

c) "All fidelity." Children are to have confidence in their parents, believing that these mean well with them, even when they themselves cannot understand the matter. They are not to rob them of anything, but rather shield them from harm, and render them help and support whenever possible. Prov. 28 : 24.

d) " Obedience," in that " I submit myself to their good instruction and correction with due obedience," and witliout contradiction or obstinacy. By instruction is to be understood all direction, as well as all commands and orders which parents give to their children ; by correction, discipline and reproof, which are administered to children on account of improper conduct or disobedience. Prov. 1 : 8 ; 15 : 5, Col. 3 : 20.

It is the duty of the child to submit to punishment without resistance, even when the same appears to it unjust. So far as " instruction" is concerned, i. e., that which the child is bidden to do by the parents, it is his duty to submit only to " good instruction." If anything should be asked of the child, which is against God's commandment, and, therefore, evil, the child must be governed by the law : " We must obey God rather than men." As it unfortunately happens that school children are occasionally instigated by their parents to petty thieving, to deception and lying, and to other sins, we cannot for any reason avoid emphasizing the idea of " good" instruction. But great care must ' be exercised in this matter.

e) " Patiently" bear with the infirmities of parents. Not only when they are sick and old, and at the same time peevish, but also in days of health, when they become capricious, irritable or angry, the child must not rise up against them. Prov. 30 : 17 ; 23 : 22. The child also must not despise its parents when they fail in leading a godly life. Compare Noah and his sons. Gen.. 9: 21-27.

B. Duties to All Superiors.

"All in authority over me." To this class belong : For domestics, their governors ; for apprentices and journeymen, their masters ; for children and adults, teachers, ministers and elders ; and for all subjects,, great and small, those in authority of every kind, ol

1. Servants, apprentices and journeymen are to show : Honor. 1 Tim. 6 : 1. — Fidelit}^ and obedience. Tit. 2: 9, 10, Col. 3: 22.— Patience. 1 Peter 2 : 18.

2. Children and adults are to show toward teachers, ministers and elders : Honor. 1 Tim. 5 : 17. — Love. 1 Thess. 5 : 12, 13.— Obedience. Heb. 13 : 17.

3. Subjects are to show toward those in authority over them : Honor. 1 Peter 2 : 17. — Love. 1 Tim. 2: 1, 2.— Fidelity. Matt. 22: 21.— Obedience. Rom. 13: 1, 2, Tit. 3 : 1.— Patience. Rom. 13: 5.

4. In all these relations it is always true that the authority of God, whose commands take precedence of all others, stands above all human authority. Acts 5: 29.

C. The Basis of These Duties.

The demand for the respect and obedience of children and subjects toward parents and superiors rests upon this, that " it pleases God to govern us by their hand." In so far tliey are God's representatives.

a) Parents. Gen. 18 : 19.

b) Those in authority. Eph. 6 : 7.

c) Ministers. Luke 10 : 16.

d) Powers. Rom. 13 : 1, 1 Peter 2: 13.

II. DUTIES OF SUPERIORS TOWARD THEIR INFERIORS.

" Since it pleases God to govern us by their hand," implies not only for parents and all superiors the right to demand respect and obedience, but also the duty, as God's representatives, to conduct themselves toward their children and subjects, and to "govern" them, according to the will of God. It is the duty of parents and of all in authority to care for the welfare of the bodies and the salvation of the souls of their children, and of those committed to them ; while ministers and teachers are chiefly to seek the salvation of the soul and the cultivation of the spirit, those in authority the preservation of civil order. But all are in duty bound to give their subjects the example of an upright life.

1. Parents. 1 Tim. 5: 8, Prov. 13 : 24, Eph. 6 : 4.

2. Those in authority. Jer. 22 : 13, Eph. 6 : 9.

3. Ministers and teachers. Ezek. 3 : 17-21, Acts 20 : 28, 2 Tim. 4 : 2, Tit. 2 : 7, 1 Peter 5 : 2, 3, Matt. 5 : 19. It is an evil day when it may be said of a minister or of a teacher that to him applies the proverb : " Follow my words and not my works."
