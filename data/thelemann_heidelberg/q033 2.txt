Because Christ alone is the eternal and natural Son of God ; but we are children adopted of God, by grace, for his sake.

If Christ in His essence is eqnal" with God, He is true God. Therefore Question 3o treats of the true Divinity of Jesus Christ.

I. Why Christ is Called the Son of God.

1. By the expression " Son of God" is indicated the relation of our Savior Jesus Christ to God. When we speak of divine things in human language, we can do so only by approximate comparisons with human relations, because human speech lacks the correspondingterms requisite to the full expression of the divine. Human offspring is of the same nature as the parent from which it is descended, so the expression " Son of God" is intended to convey the idea that Jesus Christ is of the essence of God and, therefore, God. From the divine relation, however, is excluded every distinct tion of time and of rank such as pertains to the relation of an earthly son to his father. It is for us in reality a divine mystery, even in revelation, whieh we can neither fathom in our thinking nor express in words. Ps. 139 : 6.

2. In the Scriptures Christ is spoken of as the Son of God.

a) God Himself calls Him His Son. Mark 1 : 11 ; 9: 7.

b) The devil knows and acknowledges Him as God's Son. Matt. 4 : 3, 6.

THE HEIDELBERG CATECHISM. '^£^ 131

c) His disciples acknowledge and confess Him as God's Son. John 1 : 41), Matt. 16: 1(5, John 11 : 27.

d) Christ Himself speaks of Himself as the Son of God. John 3: 16; 10: 36, Mark 14: 62.

The Jews well understood what was signified by Jesus calling God His Father, and Himself God's Son. John5: i8. (Compare John 10: 33.) So also the High Priest, Caiaphas, when solemnly assured of Jesus that He was the Son of God. Mark 14 : 63, 64.

3. Christ is the only begotten Son of God, i. e., He is begotten of God, not created, and is the only one of His Being, beside Him no other; therefore, in this unique sense Christ alone is called the Son of God. "Sou of God" is for Him, not, as it were, a mere title of eminent distinction as a man, but as the only begotten Son of God, expresses most strictly His essential divine relation. This is set forth already in the prophecies, Ps. 2 : 7—" The Lord hath said unto me. Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee." John 1 : 14, 1 John 4 : 9, Col. 1 : 15: " Firstborn of every creature." (Here the word "born" stands in sharp contrast with " creatures," i. e., everything created, and " before creation" means from before the

• beginning of time, i. e., from eternity.)

4. Christ is the eternal Son of God.

a) He is from eternity. John 1 : 1, 2. The Son of God is called the Word, because the Father reveals Himself Through Him. (Compare verse 18.) "In the beginning,'' i. e., when the world began and before any created thing was in existence. Then already the Son of God existed. He did not come into being with the beginning of all things, and He was God, i. e., of the divine essence from eternity. 1 John 1 : 1, 2, John 14 : 6, Col. 1 : 17.

b) He is also the Son of God to eternity. Heb. 13:8, Eev. 22 : 13.

5. Christ is the " natural" Son of God, i. e., like unto God the Father in essence (nature) and in glory. The word *' ni\tural" is of the same significance as " his own" in Rom. 8 : 32 : " He that spared not His own Son." John 5 : 26 ; 10: 30; 14: U, 11, Col. 2: 9.

6. The divinity of Christ is clearly proved by the fact that in the Scriptures there are attributed to the Kedeemer :

a) Divine names. Isa. 9 : 6, John 20 : 28, Acts 20 : 28, Rev. o : 9, Rom. 9 : 5, 1 John 5 : 20, Rev. 1 : 8.

Jesus Christ is spoken of by the Apostles with evident preference as " the Lord." With the same word they express God's name Jehovah in the passages which they translated from Hebrew into Greek, as had already been done by the Septuagint (the seventy " interpreters," who by arrangement of King Ptolemy Philadelphus translated the Old Testament from Hebrew into Greek at Alexandria in the third century B. C).

The apostles also refer without further explanation the word " Jehovah" to Christ.

b) Divine perfections or attributes :

1. Omniscience. John 1 : 48 ; 2 : 25 ; 21 : 17. 2. Omnipresence. Matt. 28: 20; 18: 20. 3. Omnipotence. Matt. 11: 27, John 5: 17, Matt. 28: 18, Col. 1: 16, 17. 4. Eternity. Micha 5: 2, John 8 : 58 : 17 : 5. 5. Unchangeableness. Heb. 13 : 8.

c) Divine works. 1. The creation and preservation of the world. John 1 : 3, Heb. 1 : 3. 2. Election. John 15 : 16, Acts 9 : 15. 3. The creation of the new life in man. John 6 : 47. 4. The power to forgive sins. Mark 2 : 7, 10. 5. The raising of the dead. John 5 : 21, 28, 29. 6. The holding of the final judgment. John 5 : 22, Acts 10 : 42.

d) Divine honors. John 5: 23, Heb. 1: 3. The honor which belongs exclusively to God is that of worship. This also belongs to Christ, the Son of God.

Luke 24 : 52, Acts 7 : 59, Rev. 5 : 8, 9, Heb. 1 : 6. 7. When Christ represents Himself as subordinate to the Father, John 14 : 28, Mark 13 : 32, it is to be understood in the sense that the Son of God at His incarnation laid aside His divine glory, and for the purpose of accomplishing the work of redemption voluntarily humbled Himself, i. e., subordinated Himself and became subject to the Father. The dependence and subordination can only be regarded as apparent when Christ says, John 5 : 19, 20, " The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seetli the Father do ... . and sheweth him all things that himself doeth." This has reference more particularly to unity of being and harmony of will, as may be inferred from the intervening words, " for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise." So also verse 21 sets forth the independence of the accordant wills : " For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them ; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will."

11. Why we are Called Children of God.

1. All who have been baptized and heartily believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, as their only Savior, are called children of God. John 1 : 12, Eph. 1 : o. Gal. 3 : 26, 27, Rom. 8 : 10.

2. The Savior called those that believe in Him His brothers and sisters, therefore children of God. Mark 3 : 35, John 20 : 17.

3. But there is a difference between Christ, the Son of God, and believers who are also the children of God, which consists in this, that He is the eternal and natural Son of God, i. e., like Him in essence, while we are : a) By nature children of wrath, i. e., on account of sin we have exposed ourselves to judgment and to eternal death, Eph. 2 : 3, and we become the children of God only by regeneration (Rom. 8: 14). It is b) through

grace, Eph. 1 : 4, and c) for Christ's sake that we are accepted as the children of God. We are adopted children, next to the son of the house. Eph. 1 : (>, 2 Cor. 6: 17, 18, Heb. 2: 11.

4. Childhood is regarded in the world as the happiest time and the pleasantest relation in life. We sing and say : O happy days of childhood ! The happiest condition upon earth is to be a child of God, through faith in Christ, the Son of God. For this endures throughout eternity. This sonship includes :

a) The disposition of childhood. Matt. 5 : 9.

b) The privilege of childhood to come before the father with all our cares. Rom. 8: 15.

c) The discipline of childhood. Heb. 12 : 6, 7.

d) The affection of childhood. 1 John 4 : 19.

e) The inheritance of childhood, eternal salvation and glory. Rom. 8 : 17.
