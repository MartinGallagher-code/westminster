For f)ne who is very niau, aud perfectly righteous ; and yet more powerful than all creatures ; that is, one who is also very God.

1. Since we cannot deliver ourselves, and no other mere creature can make satisfaction for us, we must seek elsewhere for a Mediator and Deliverer, who can make satisfaction for all that is needful for our redemption.

2. A mediator is one who, standing between two parties and, possessing the necessary prerogatives, reconciles and unites them. Something analogous is found in the office of an arbitrator. Such an one must be im])artial. Gal. 3 : 20. " Now a mediator is not a mediator of one" (one party). He must, therefore, be equally distant or equally near to both parties.

3. The necessary qualifications of a Mediator between God and man are :

a) That he be a true man, i. e., one who possesses body and soul and all the essential attributes of man.

b) A righteous man, i. e., one who is himself without any sin whatsoever, and who keeps the law of God perfectly. Heb. 7 : 26.

c) More powerful and higher than all creatures, that with his righteousness he may make full satisfaction in the day of judgment.

d) He must, therefore, be at the same time true God. Heb. 7 : 26, Hos. 1 : 7, Jer. 23 : 6.

e) God and man in one person. Isa. 7 : 17. Immanuel, i. <?., God with us. For a Mediator who were God only, could not suffer and die, and thus could not bear the punishment ; and a Mediator who were mere man, would not have the power to bear the burden of God's eternal wrath. He must be man in order to render obedience and to be able to die ; he must be God that his obedience and death may be of endless power and eternal value. If he were God only or a mere man, he would not be a Mediator between God and man.

/) We might further add that it is essential that the

Mediator be designated by the injured party, i. e., by God, and that he himself be willing and ready to take upon himself the work of mediation.
