Because he hath redeemed us, both soul and body, from all our sius, not with gold or silver, but with his precious blood, and hath delivered us from all the power of the devil, and thus hath made us his own property.

I. From What Christ hath Redeemed us.

To redeem signifies to liberate, to free, more particularly to ransom. The statements of the Catechism that He " hath redeemed us . . . and delivered us . . . . and thus made us his own property," are not tautological, but are to be understood as signifying that Christ hath ])urchased our freedom from sin, not in the sense that we belong to ourselves or to some one else, but rather that in so doing He made us His own property.

1. According to the law of Moses, an impoverished Israelite could sell himself as a servant or slave to a

foreign resident of Canaan. The freedom of such a one could be purchased before the year of jubilee (the 5()th year), in which all slaves became free without recompense, and it was the duty of his brother or of his next of kin to secure his freedom when he himself had not earned enough to do it. Lev. 25 : 47-54. By nature we are all impoverished and in debt through sin. Kom. 3 : 23. Therefore we are sold under sin and have come under the power of the one who is the cause of sin, the devil, the alien. Rom. 7 : 14 ; 6 : 17. In this servitude we can not earn for ourselves anything before God, with which to purchase our redemption. Rom. 3 : 12. Neither can a brother in the flesh, nor a mere man redeem us. Ps. 49 : 7, 8. But that we may not forever remain in servitude, the Son of God became man, i. e., became our brother, in order to redeem us. 1 Tim. 2 : 5,6.

3. Christ hath redeemed us from sin.

a) From the guilt of sin. Col. 2 : 14.

b) From the dominion of sin. Rom. (3 : 14.

c) From the punishment of sin, which is death. 1. From the fear of death. Heb. 2 : 15. 2. From spiritual death. 1 John 3 : 14. 3. From eternal death. John 8 : 51, Rom. 5 : 9.

4. Christ hath redeemed us and delivered us from the power of the devil. Through sin we have not become the property of the devil, we have only come under his power. God remains the real Lord over all men. Therefore Christ paid the ransom, not to the devil, but to God (Eph. 5:2), to satisfy His righteousness, i. e., His rightful claims. At the same time He was surrendered to the power, but not to the ownership of the devil, and therefore could not be holden by the same. Luke 22 : 53, John 14 : 30, Heb. 2 : 14.

II. The Means by Which Christ hath Redeemed us.

1. In the redemption of slaves the ransom consisted of silver or gold, and only outward servitude and temporal freedom were involved therein. But deliverance from sin implies that both body and soul are set free and redeemed for eternity, which can not be done with perishable silver or gold. Tlie value of a single human soul is so great that all the silver and gold of tlie whole world can not redeem it. Matt. 16 : 20.

2. According to the decree of the love and mercy of God, only the blood of His Son, i. e., the complete surrender of His life, even to a violent and bloody death, was to constitute and could be accepted as the ransom. The blood of Christ is called " precious," because it has sufficient worth to redeem all the chosen ones at all times and in all the world, and to bring them into the freedom of the children of God. Matt. 20 : 28 ; 26 : 28, Eph. 1 : 7, 1 Peter 1 : 18, 10, Rev. 5 : 9.

III. The Purpose of our Redemption.

1. All those whom Christ hath redeemed and purchased with His precious blood, have thereby become His property, and He is their Lord. Tit. 2 : 14, Acts 2: 36.

2. True believers are therefore Christ's property, and only when we have been born again by the Holy Ghost can we call Him " our Lord." Eph. 1 : 13, 14,

1 Cor. 12 : 3.

3. This ownership of Christ in us w^e are to manifest :

a) By honoring Him in body and soul. 1 Cor. (> ; 20.

b) By joyfully obeying Him. Luke 1 : 74, 75, Matt. 7: 21.

c) By humbly submitting to His will. 1 Peter 5 : 6,

2 Samuel 15 : 26.

d) By serving Him only. 1 Cor. 7 : 23, 2 Peter 2 : 1, Jude, verse 4.

4. The heathen are also the inheritance of Christ. Ps. 82 : 8, John 11 : 51, 52, Rev. 7 : 9, 10.

5. Christ is Lord over all, even over the unbelieving and over His enemies, although they do not acknowledge Him as Lord and are not willing to subject themselves to Him. Luke 19 : 14, 1 Cor. 15 :' 25, Phil. 2: 10.

THE TWOFOLD STATE OF CHRIST. (Ques. 35-52.)

1. Upon the basis of the Scriptural truth expressed in Phil. 2 : 6-11, we speak of a twofold state of Christ, His state of humiliation and His state of exaltation. It was necessary that Christ should humble Himself to secure our salvation, and that He should be exalted to impart to us His purchased redemption. Luke 24 : 26, Rom. 4: 25, Heb. 2: 7-10.

2. The state of Christ's humiliation is characterized by five stages : 1. His incarnation, 2. His suffering, 3. His death, 4. His burial, 5. His descent into hell. The state of Christ's exaltation embraces four stages : 1. His resurrection, 2. His ascension into heaven, 3. His sitting at the right hand of God, 4. His coming again to judgment.

3. This twofold state of Christ was already prophesied in the Old Testament. Isa. 53.

a) He grew up as a tender plant out of a dry ground — He hath no form nor comeliness — He was despised and rejected of men ; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief — He was oppressed, afflicted, wounded, bruised, smitten of God. b) But then He shall prolong His days — the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hands — He shall justify many — He shall divide the spoil with the strong.

4. In the New Testament the twofold state of Christ is set forth by the Apostle Paul in Phil. 2 : 6-11. a) Who, being in the form of God, counted it not a prize

to be on an equality with God (John 17: 5) — taking tlie form of a servant — being made in the likeness of men — humbled Himself — becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross, b) Wherefore also God highly exalted Him — gave unto Him the name which is above every name — that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow — and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
