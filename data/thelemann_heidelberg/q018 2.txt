Our Lord Jesus Christ ; who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness, and sanctifi cation, and redemption.

I. Jesus Christ is the Only and True Mediator.

1. Moses was also called a mediator. He was the mediator of the old covenant between God and the people of Israel. But ids mediatorial office consisted only in this, that by the power of God he led His peopie out of external bondage and delivered to them tlie law of God. Gal. 3 : 19. " It was ordained .... by the hand of a mediator" (Moses). But he was a sinful man like his fellows. On account of his sins he could not even lead his people into the earthly land of promise. The law whose mediator he was serves only to bring to a knowledge of sin, but it cannot create life and health and salvation.

2. Christ is placed over against Moses as the true Mediator. John 1 : 17, Heb. 3 : 1-6.

3. Christ is testified to as the onlv Mediator. 1 Tim. 2 : 5, 6, Heb. 8 : 6 ; 9 : 15 ; 12 : 24, John 14 : 6.

a) By His birth. Gal. 4 : 4, Heb. 2 : 14.

b) In all His life on earth He proved Himself man. Phil 2 : 7.

d) He had human needs. Luke 8 : 23, Matt. 4 : 2, John 4 : 7 ; 19 : 28, Mark 4 : 38.

e) He had human sensations. John 11 : 33, 35, Luke 12 : 50 ; 22 : 44.

/) Also in death He was like man in that He experienced a separation of body and soul. Luke 23 : 46 ; John 19 : 33, 34.

2. Christ was a righteous man.

He was without sin. Luke 1 : 35, John 8 : 46, 1 Peter 2 : 22 ; 3 : 18, Heb. 4 : 15.

in. Christ is Given Unto Us by God for Complete Redemption and

1. Satisfaction had to be made to the justice of God through a perfect Mediator. Sinful humanity could not produce such an one. God, therefore, according to His eternal counsel of grace, provided a way and means, in that He united with His righteousness, with His demand for a jDerfect satisfaction in obedience and suffering, His unfathomable love and mercy, and gives unto us out of free grace the only true Mediator, Jesus Christ. John 3 : 10.

b) He has made perfect atonement through His suffering. Rom. 5 : 8, 9, 1 Peter 3 : 18.

3. Therefore he is made unto us by God wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption. 1 Cor. 1 : 30.

a) Wisdom. Col. 2 : 3, John 8 : 12.

b) Righteousness. Rom. 3 : 25, 2 Cor. 5 : 21.

c) Sanctification. John 17 : 19, 1 John 1 : 7.

d) Redemption. Eph. 1 : 7, Heb. 9 : 12, Luke 21 : 28, Rev. 21 : 4, 5, 2 Tim. 4 : 18.
