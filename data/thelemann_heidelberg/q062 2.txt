Because that the righteousness, which can be approved of before the tribunal of God, must be absolutely perfect, and in all respects conformable to the divine law : and also that our best works in this life are all imperfect and defiled with sin.

1. As little as we are justified before God on account of our faith, so little also are we justified on account of good works which are fruits of faith and which neither by themselves nor in connection with faith constitute our righteousness.

2. The idea of righteousness by works springs from pride and from an impenitent heart which is not disposed to humble itself thoroughly and to receive anything as a reward without personal merit.

3. Righteousness by works cannot stand aside of righteousness by faith and is impossible in the sight of God. For God demands a righteousness *' absolutely perfect," conformed to His law in the greatest as well as in the least. Matt. 22 : 37, 39, Gal. 3 : 10, James 2 : 10, 11.

4. Under " good works " and " our best works " are here not to be understood the works of the natural, but of the regenerate, renewed man. These also cannot stand before the demands of the divine law, because they are " imperfect," i. e., they do not fully answer these demands and are defiled with sin, especially with the sin of selfishness. (Compare Peter, " Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee ; what shall we have therefore?" Matt. 19: 27.) Phil. 3: 12, Isa. 64: 6.

5. The Word of God excludes clearly and definitely all meritoriousness as the entire or partial cause of righteousness. Gal. 2 : 16, Pom. 11:6, Gal. 2 : 21.

6. Of ourselves we do not have the power to perform good works, and, therefore, in their ultimate ground we cannot claim them as our own. John 15 : 5, 1 Cor. 4 : 7.

7. Paul and James both appeal to the example of Abraham, Paul on behalf of faith and James on behalf of works, without, however, contradicting each other. Paul speaks (Pom. 4) of those who wish to derive their justification from good works ; James (James 2 : 1426) speaks of professors who say that they have faith, but who do not possess that living faith from which good works (as its fruit) proceed, without, however, becoming meritorious.

8. Example. The rich young man. Matt. 19 : 1622. With all his keeping of the law, the young man lacked the real foundation, faith and love, a new heart, from which selfishness has been driven out.

ftupstion 63

What ! do not our good works merit, which yet God will reivard in this and a future life f

This reward is not of merit, but of grace.

Questions 63 and 64 treat of two objections which are brought against the doctrine of justification by faith only, the one (Question 63} is plainly based upon the Scriptures, the other (Question 64) upon experience.

I. The Promised Reward.

1. To those who walk in righteousness and holiness before God, a reward, a recompense, is promised in God's Word. Gen. 15 : 1, Matt. 5 : 12, 1 Tim. 4 : 8.

2. The promised reward is prosperity in this life, eternal salvation and glory in the future life. Eph. 6 : 2, 3, 1 Peter 5 : 4.

II. The Reward Not of Merit.

1. It is not a reward which God owes to us (Rom. 11 : 35), neither is there a reward we can demand of God ; for

a) We are under obligation to do good works. Luke 17: 10.

b) It is God Himself who works in us, both to will and to do good works. Phil. 2 : 13.

g) God does not stand in need of our good works. Acts 17 : 24.

d) There is no relation between the service rendered and the reward bestowed. Matt. 25 : 21.

2. But those who think that godliness is a profession (1 Tim. 6 : 5) in the pursuit of which one may earn by good works the reward promised for the present and the future life, are " proud, knowing nothing " (verse 4). Luke 13: 25-27.

III. The Reward is of Grace.

1. The day-laborer receives wages for service rendered, which form a recompense for his labor. The wages are therefore regulated according to his work. As the labor, so the reward, says the proverb. But it is otherwise with the father, who, in order to show his love for his child and to bring it joy, rewards it for having served him faithfully and for having labored out of love to him. In this case the measure of service does not determine the measure of the reward. Ps. 103: 13.

2. When the wages exceed the value of the work, it is grace which is thereby manifested. This is the case with the rewards which God gives, and we can, therefore, speak only of a reward of grace. John 4 : 3(3-38, Matt. 20 : 14, 15. The thief on the cross received the reward of grace without the least work. Luke 23 : 43.

3. The Lord promises the reward of grace to His own.

a) To show that He is pleased with good works. Matt. 25: 21; 10: 41,42.

b) To encourage His own to persevere in the race of life and to endure its conflicts and its sufferings. 1 Cor. 9 : 24, 2 Tim. 2 : 5, Heb. 11 : 26, Rev. 2: 10.
