Because God hath so revealed himself in his word that these three distinct persons are the only true and eternal God.

I. The One Divine Being in Three Persons.

1. The words " triune," " trinity," do not occur in the Bible, and the catechism, in conformity with its pure

biblical character, avoids the use of it. But it is u concise expression of the doctrine, which the catechism also presents on the basis of the divine revelation in the Scriptures as the fundamental doctrine of the ('hristian faith. The expression came into use in the doctrinal discussions of the first centuries, when the truth of Ciiristian doctrine needed to be defended against heretics. The so-called Athanasitin creed sums uj) the result in tlie following sentences :

And the true Christian faith is this : That we worship one God in trinity, and trinity in unity ; neither confounding the persons : nor dividing the substance.

For there is one person of the Father : another of the Son : and another of the Holy Ghost. But the godhead of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy is all one : the glory equal, the majesty eternal.

Such as the Father is : such is the Son : and such the Holy Ghost.

The Father uncreated : the Son uncreated : and the Holy Ghost uncreated.

The Father unlimited : the Son unlimited : and the Holy Ghost unlimited.

The Father eternal : the Son eternal : and the Holy Ghost eternal. And yet thei-e are not three eternals, but one eternal. As also there are not three uncreated, nor three infinites, but one uncreated and one infinite.

So likewise the Father is almighty : the Son almighty : and the Holy Ghost almighty. And yet there are not three Almighties : but one Almighty.

So the Father is God : the Son is God : and the Holy Ghost is God. And yet there are not three Gods : but one God.

So likewise the Father is Lord : the Son Lord : and the Holy Ghost Lord. And yet not three Lords : but one Lord.

For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every Person by Himself to be God and Lord : So we are forbidden by the Christian faith so say there are three Gods or three Lords.

The Father is made of none, neither created nor begotten.

The Son is of the Father alone, not made nor created, but begotten.

The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son, neither made nor begotten, but proceeding.

So there is one Father, not three Fathers ; one Son, not three Sons : one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts.

And in this Trinity none is afore or after another; none is greater nor less than another. But the whole three Persons are coeternal and coequal.

So that in all things, as aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.

The Latin \Nord perso7ia does not expressly occur in the Bible, but an expression which means the same thing is found in Heb. 1 : 3, " the express image of his person." By person we understand a self-conscious and independent being, who by His own power can say " I." It is self-evident that this human mode of speech is a defective representation of the Divine Being, as God Himself cannot be defined (limited, ideally represented), because He is unlimited, and to comprehend Him perfectly, surpasses man's power of thought. God dwells in thick darkness (1 Kings 8: 12), and God dwells in light which no man can approach unto (1 Tim. 6: 16), have the same meaning, namely that God's Being cannot be comprehended by man, who can know God only in so far as He is pleased to reveal Himself.

2. The invisible God we can know only from His revelation of Himself There are three modes of divine revelation :

a) Creation. Kom. 1 : 19, 20, Heb. 3 : 4.

b) Conscience. Rom. 2 : 14, 15.

c) From creation we can learn in general, that there is a God, and that He is omnipotent and all-wise ; from conscience, that there is a holy and just God, who hates and punishes evil. But these modes of cognition do not lead us any further. Only the revelation contained in His Word enables us to attain a full knowledge of God, in so far as this is possible to man, (Ex. 82 : 18-28), without the last veil being lifted. This will take place when we shall ])ass from faith to sight, and shall see God face to face (1 Cor. 18 : 12 j.

3. God has revealed His Being in His Word.

a) By His names.

b) By the testimony of the Spirit.

a) The most important names are : God, Jehovah, Sabaoth, Lord. God or Elohim ex))resses the fuiness of all perfection ; Jehovah, His eternal and unchangeable Being ; Sabaoth, the fulness of His power, and Lord, the possession of highest, unlimited power, His sovereignty.

b) The testimony of the Spirit :

I. God is one. He in Jrlimself is one and is the only true God, besides whom there is none other (Deut. (\: 4, Mark 12 : 29). It was the high calling of Israel among all nations to preserve the knowledge of the one true God. (Isa. 48 : 11, Hosea 18 : 4, Isa. 42 : 8, 1 Cor, 8: 4-()).

II. God is a Spirit. He is perfect in His attributes, and unlimited. He penetrates and fills all things (John 4: 24).

III. God is light. He is the Fountain of all wisdom. (1 John 1 : C), James 1 : 17).

IV. God is love. He does not wraj) himself up in Himself, but communicates Himself and His gifts ; from Him alone comes all true love. (1 dohn 4: 16).

V. God is life. He alone is the living One and the

Fountain of all life. (John h : 26, John 14 : 6, Jer. 10: 10).

4. Especially has God thus revealed Himself in His Word that these three distinct persons (Father, Son and Holy Ghost) are the only true eternal God.

a) The Trinity is foreshadowed in the Old Testament, but the knowledge thereof is veiled. (Gen. 1 : 1, 2, 3, John 1 : 1-3, Ps. 33 : 6, Numb. (3 : 24-26, Isa. 6 : 3, Isa. 48: 16).

b) The Trinity is clearly revealed in the New Testament. (Matt. 3 : 1(\, 17, Matt. 28 : 19, Acts 20: 28, 2 Cor. 13: 14, 1 Peter 1:2).

5. Personality, i. e., distinct self-consciousness and independence (the Ego) of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is clearly seen in the following passages of Scripture, in which are ascribed to each of the three, personal attributes, understanding and will, as well as separate acts and different names (Father, Son and Holy Ghost). The succession is determined by the time of their special revelation (creation, redemption, sanctification).

a) God the Father. Heis the invisible One. (^Eph. 4: 6, Matt. 3: 17, John 14, 16).

b) God the Son. He is the One who reveals. In the Old Testament the angel of the Lord with Abraham and Moses, the cloud in the desert, and in the Holy of Holies, the face of God (Ex. 3), the rock which followed them (1 Cor. 10: 4). In the New Testament, John 1 : 18, Matt. 11 : 27, John 1 : 1, 14, John 5 : 26, Heb. 1 : 3, 1 John 3 : 8, John 10 : 30, Acts 9 : 5.

c) God the Holy Ghost. He is the Mediator through whom God communicates Himself (John 14 : 26, Acts 5: 3, 4, Acts 10: 19, 20, Acts 13: 2, 1 Cor. 12: 11).

6. The three persons in the Godhead are one in essence, but there is a distinction in their acts. They are distinct, but not separate. If one were to ask how it is

possible that one equals three and three equals oue, the answer would be, the ineoniprohensible God is not an arithmetical problem. The Trinity is uot contrary to reason, but above reason ; and notwithstanding the revelation which we have, will forever remain for us, (who are limited in our understanding of the divine i-elations,) an unfathomable secret, which we believe without making it the object of subtle inquiry (Rom. 11 : oo).

7. The doctrine of tht Holy Trinity is fundamental in the Christian faith. It distinguishes Christianity essentially on the one hand from tlie rigid monotheism of the Jews and of Mohammedanism, and on the other hand from the deification of the universe, and the polytheism of the heathen.

U. The Attributes of God.

It is customary to treat the attributes of God in connection with question 25. A mere enumeration and definition of them is, however, not sufficient. Instruction must use them for admonition as well as for comfort, and must be enlivened by the introduction of biblical history and suitable stanzas or hymns. It may also be recommended that the children be encouraged to look up illustrations in the biblical history with which they are familiar, thereby inducing them to make practical use of the Word of God.

1. The Being of God does not divide itself in Hisattributes, as a whole may be separated into its parts ; for these " attributes" are only the effulgence, the manifestations of His Being in different relations, as the same light of the sun manifests itself in the different colors of the rainbow.

2. We distinguish the attributes of God ;

a. In His relation to the world.

b. In His relation to man.

e. In His relation to Himself.
