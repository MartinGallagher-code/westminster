Christ speaks thus not without great reason, namely, not only thereby to teach us that as bread and wine support this temporal life, so his crucified body and shed blood are' the true meat and drink whereby our souls are fed to eternal life ; but more especially by these visible signs and pledges to assure us that we are as really partakers of his true body and blood (by the operation of the Holy Ghost), as we receive by the mouths of our bodies these holy signs in remembrance of him ; and that all his sufferings and obedience are as certainly ours, as if we had in our own persons suffered and made satisfaction for our sins to God.

1. Bread and wine are the choicest aliments for the preservation and strengthening of the temporal, life. In like manner the crucified body of Christ and His shed blood are the true food and drink of the soul unto eternal life. Christ wished to teach us this first of all when He called the bread His body and the cup His blood, and Paul, when he applied these to the communion of the body and blood of Christ. Ps. 104 : 14, 15, John 6 : 55, 56, 49, 51.

2. When Christ calls the bread His body and the cup His blood, He wishes further not only to teach us by these signs, but He also makes use of them as pledges and seals, by which He would assure us:

a) That we truly become partakers of His body and blood, not by the eating of the pledges, the bread and the wine, but by the operation of the Holy Ghost. 1 Cor. 10: 16.

b) That the merit which He secured for us by the offering of His body and blood unto death is assuredly our own. 1 Cor. 11 : 26.
