Because he is ordained of God the Father, and anointed with the Holy Ghost to be our chief Prophet and teacher ; who has fully revealed to us the secret counsel and will of God concerning our redemption, and to be our only High Priest, who, by the one sacrifice of his body, has redeemed us, and makes continual intercession with the Father for us ; and also to be our eternal King, who governs us by his word and Spirit, and who defends and preserves us in the enjoyment of that salvation he has purchased for us.

I. The Name Christ. 1. Christ (from the Greek) and Messiah (from the Hebrew) have the same signification : the anointed one. It is the official name of the Savior, as Jesus is His personal name. Daniel already prophesies (9 : 25, 26) of " Christ (Messiah, the anointed), the Prince." By this name He is spoken of by the angel at His birth. Luke 2:11. As such He is first recognized by His disciples. John 1 : 41. As such Peter confesses Him in faith. Matt. 16: 16. Whether he is the Messiah, all the people desired to know. John 10 : 24. He acknowledges Himself as such with an oath before the Sanhedrim. Matt. 26: 63, 64. Jesus said unto him : thou sayestit {%. e., I affirm I am Christ). Also iifter His resurrectioii He testifieil before His disciples that He is the Messiali, Christ. Luke 24: 26, Acts 9: 22.

2. Christ was appointed, i. e., fore-ordained by God the Father from eternity as Redeemer. Prov. 8 : 23. " I (Eternal Wisdom or the eternal word, John 1:1, 4, 9) was set up (fore-ordained, appointed) from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was."

o. He was anointed by God the Father, i. e., endowed with the Holy Ghost. As the Son of God He is from eternity one with the Holy Ghost ; as man He was visibly anointed with the Holy Ghost by God the Father, when He entered upon His ministry, through the baptism of John in the Jordan. John testified and said : I saw the Spirit descending . . . and it abode upon Him. John 1 : 32, 34. Christ Himself attested it. Luke 4 : 18. The apostles bore witness to it. Acts 4 : 27 ; 10 : 38, Heb. 1 : 9.

4. In the old covenant the following were called anointed of God, because they were anointed with oil for their office :

a) The prophets, e. ^., Elisha (1 Kings 19 : 16). Ps. lOo: 15 : Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. ("Anointed" signifies the same here as " prophet.")

b) The high priests. Ex. 30 : 30, Lev. 8 : 12.

c) The kings, e. ^., Saul (1 Sam. 10: 1), David (1 Sam. 16: 2, 3, 13), Solomon (1 Kings 1 : 39).

5. This anointing was with oil, which wms poured upon the head. The oil which was rubbed into the body in the orient in order to make the limbs supple and strong for work as well as for battle, was used as an emblem in the anointing of the prophets, high priests and kings. Sucii an external anointing with oil was to be to them an assurance that they were regularly called to their office by God, and that God favored them with the needful gifts of His Spirit, of which the oil was an

emblem, and prepared them for the administration of their office. Christ was not anointed with the oil, the emblem, but with the Holy Ghost Himself in a visible manner at His baptism, and not throu,2:h men, but directly by God the Father. Matt. 3 : iV.

II. The Threefold Office of Christ.

The threefold office to which Christ was appointed and anointed by God the Father, consists in the office of: 1. Prophet or Teacher, 2. High Priest or Mediator, and 3. King or Ruler. The Savior not only filled these offices in His work upon eartli, but His activity in these three directions still continues.

A. The Office of Prophet or Teacher.

1. The prophets of the old covenant were men who were immediately called by God and were guided by the Holy Ghost, to preach repentance to the people of God, to reform them in worship and conduct, to reveal hidden and future events, and especially to prophesy of the future Redeemer. In attestation of their mission God had given them the power to perforin signs and wonders. Jer. 1 : 7, 2 Peter 1 : 21. Signs and wonders as attestations of His divine mission for the benefit of Moses himself (Ex. 3 : 12), and for the benefit of the people (Ex. 3: 4, 5, 8).

2. Christ is the prophet who was foretold by Moses (Deut. 18 : 15), As such He is designated by God the Father, Matt. 17 : 5 ; recognized by the people, John 6 : 14 ; and confessed by the apostles. Acts 3 : 22.

3. Christ is our chief prophet and teacher because He has fully revealed to us the secret (hidden) counsel and will of God (which no one could know of himself) concerning our redemption (that we can be saved only through Jesus Ckrist)— Col. 1 : 20 : "The mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations,

120 THE HE[DELBKRG CATPX'HISM.

but now is made manifest to liis saints." On this account He stands above all })rophets.

a) The prophets revealed the secret counsel of God only in parts, as much as was given to them by God. Dan. 12: 9, Matt, lo: 17. But Christ hath declared all things. John 1: LS ; lo: 15.

b) All the prophets pi-ophesied of Christ. Acts 10: 43.

c) All the prophets prophesied through Christ. 1 Peter 1 : 11.

4. Christ performed His prophetic or teaching office :

a) Thi'ougli His teaching ; He taught the law (sermon on the mount, Matt. 5-7), preached repentance, and proclaimed the kingdom of God (Mark 1 : 15). Of the kingdom of God He spoke mostly in parables, the material of which He selected from creation or the experiences of men to declare the nature and the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, e. (/., Matt. 13 : 35, Luke 15. While through these the kingdom of God was to be revealed to His discijdes, it was to be hidden from unbelievers. Matt. 13 : 11.

b) Through the cleansing of the temple, at the beginning of His pi'ophetic office, John 2 : 13-17, and at the end of it. Matt. 21 : 11-13.

c) Through His prophecies concei-ning the destruction of Jerusalem, the end of the world, and the future of the kingdom of God. Matt. 24.

d) Through His life. John 4: 34; 8: 12, 4(1, 1 Peter 2: 21.

e) Through His miracles, which served at the same time as an attestation of His divine mission. Matt. 11 : 2-6, John 14: 11; 10: 25, 38; 3: 2, Luke 24: ll>. The miracles of Christ included : 1. The healing of all manner of sickness (all kinds of diseases and sickness among the people, Matt. 4 : 23 ; and those who were under the power of the devil, the possessed. Acts 10:

38) either by toucli, e. y., the lepers, Matt. 8:8; or by a mere word, e. (j., blind Eartimaeus, Mark 10 : 52 ; or at a distance, e. g., the dauohter of the Caiiaaiiitish v;onian, Matt. 15: 28. 2. Raisuig of the dead, of which three instances are reported in the gospels : Jairus's daughter who had just died, Matt. 1) : 18; the widow's son at Nain, whom they were already bearing to the grave, Luke 7 : 12; Lazarus at Betliany, who had already lain four days in the grave, John 11 : o\). o. Miracles of power, elohn 2: 11: He manifested forth His glory, i. e., His power over the creation, e.^., the changing of water into wine at Cana (John 2: 1-10), the feeding of the thousands in the desert with a few loaves (Matt. 14 : 14-21 ; Mark 8 : 1-9), walking upon the sea (Matt. 14 : 25), the stillin«/ of the tempest (Mark 4 : 31)), the withering of the fig tree (Matt. 21 : 19). On the contrary Christ never performed a miracle for mere show, and when solicited so to do by Satan (Matt. 4 : 5-7) and the Pharisees (Mark 8 : 11, 12), positively refused to gratify them.

/) To the end of the world, through the teaching office instituted by Him. Matt. 28 : 19, Luke 10 : 16, 2 Cor. 5: 20, Eph. 4 : 11.

B. The Office of High Priest or Mediator.

1. The function of priest under the old covenant was to offer sacrifices and to represent the people before God. The high priest's duty was to make an offering for the sins of all the people once a year on the great day of atonement, after he had made a sacrifice for his own sins, and with the blood of tlie victim to go into the holy of holies, which he alone was allowed to enter, in order to sprinkle with the blood the mercy seat (the lid of the ark of the covenant). Lev. 16. Further, the high priest carried upon his breast the Urim and Thummim (" light and truth") as a breastplate or " badge of office,"

made of gold aiul decorated with precious stones (Ex. 28 : 15-30), on which were inscribed the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, that he might "bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart continually" and remember them with intercession before the Lord. Lastly, it was the duty of the high priest to bless the people with uplifted hands. Lev. 9: 22. (Aaron's blessing, Num. 6: 22-27.)

2. Christ is the High Priest of the new covenant, of which the high priest of the old covenant was a type. Heb. 3 : 1 ; 4 : 14. He fulfills His high priestly ofhce :

a) In that He redeemed us with the one sacrifice of His body. Heb. 10 : 10, Eph. 5 : 2, 1 Peter 2 : 24.

b) In that He represents us at all times with His intercession before the Father. The high priestly praver, John 17, Luke 23 : 34, 1 John 2 : 1, Rom. 8 : 34, Heb. 7: 25.

c) In that He blesses His own. And His blessing is not a mere wish, but a real imparting of 2;ood. Mark 10 : 16, Luke 24 : 50, Eph. 1:3.

3. Christ as the High Priest of the new covenant is greater than the one of the old covenant. Let us compare the two :

a) The high priest of the old covenant was a sinful man who had to make a sacrifice first for his own sins — Christ the holy one of God was without sin. Heb. 7 : 27.

b) The former offered an animal -Christ offered Himself. Heb. 13: 12.

c) The former entered the earthly holy of holies — Christ the heavenly. Heb. 9 : 12.

d) The former had to repeat the sacrifice every year — Christ " was once offered to bear the sins of many." Heb. 9 : 28.

e) The former offered sacrifices only for the sins of Israel — Christ is the propitiation for the sins of the whole world (of all men, in all the world and in all

tiinesj who shall be saved through Him. 1 John 2 : 2. /) The former was mortal and had successors in office — Christ ever liveth and hath established an eternal redemption ; therefore He is our only High Priest. Heb. 7 : 21, 23, 24 : " Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchisedec." (Ps. 110: 4). "They truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death : but this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood." (Heb. 7: 24).

C. The Office of King or Ruler.

1. A king is a ruler by the grace of God, who is set over a kingdom in which he governs his subjects by law, and which he defends against enemies by arms.

2. Christ is our eternal King,

a) He is appointed by God. Ps. 2 : 6.

b) He has a kingdom, the " Kingdom of God," or the " Kingdom of heaven." John 18 : 36, 37.

c) He ascended His kingly throne at His ascension and proclaimed His government. Matt. 28 : 18, Eph. 1 : 20-22.

d) His subjects are His believing children. Ps. 110: 3, Eph. 1: 22.

e) The limits of His kingdom are the ends of the earth. Acts 1 : 8, Ps. 93: 1.

/) He is at all times the "Augmenter (Mehrer des Reichs) of the Kingdom," which He wins not by force of arms, but by the word of His mouth. Isa. 60 : 5, Acts 2 : 47, Eev. 7 : 9, Matt. 28 ; 19, Isa. 53 : 12.

ff) The duration of His reign is eternal, Ps, 93 : 2, Luke 1 : 33, Rev. 11 : 15; 17 : 14.

3. Christ administers His kingly office in three directions :

a) He governs us 1) By His word (law and gospel), in which He reveals His will. (The sermon on the mount is the law of the kingdom), Ps. 110: 2, John

14 : 23, Heb. 4:12. 2) By His spirit, through which He gives to us the strength to fulfill His will. Ps. 143: 10, John 16: 13.

b) He protects us in the purchased redemption against enemies who would rob us of the same, i. e., the devil, the world and our own flesh. Ps. 110 : 2, Rom. 16: 20, Matt. 16: 18, John 10: 28.

c) He ujiholds us, for he constantly renews our strength and secures us against apostasy. Ps. 71 : 16, Isa. 40: 31, Rom. 8 : 37, 1 Cor. 1 : 8.

m. The Advantage of the Threefold Office of Christ.

1. What Christ has done for us in the exercise of His threefold office may be summarized as follows : As prophet he revealed in His teaching office the way of salvation ; as High Priest by His obedience in His mediatorial work He secured our salvation ; as King since His exaltation in His kingdom He communicates salvation.

2. To this corresponds what Christ accomplishes in us by the exercise of His threefold office. Through His activity in His prophetic office our understanding is enlightened ; by means of His high priesthood our conscience is set at rest ; by His kingly reign our will is sanctified.
