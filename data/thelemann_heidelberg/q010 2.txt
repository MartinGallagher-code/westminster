By no means, but is terribly displeased with our original as well as actual sins; and will punish them in his just judgment temporally and eternally, as he hath declared, " Cursed is every one that contiuueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.

I. The Wrath of God Against Sin.

1. Sin and its guilt is the first part of our misery ; the punishment of sin the second.

2. The wrath of God is not a violent asfitation of the mind, or a passion like the anger of man which arises from his sinful flesh. Prov. 27 : 4, James 1 : 20. The wrath of God, of which the Scripture of the Old and New Testament speaks in numerous passages, is rather the expression of God's holy will, according to which He hates and punishes everything that is opposed to His holiness. God's wrath rests upon His holiness and righteousness, which manifest themselves through it. Because of His holiness, God hates, i. e., hath no pleasure in wickedness. Ps. 5 : 4, 5. Because of His righteousness, God punishes wickedness, which is forbidden by Him. Rom. 1 : 18. " For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness." Therefore God " will" and cannot let disobedience and apostasy, i. e., sin, go unpunished.

o. God's anger is terrible. This means not merely that He punishes sin with punishments so fearful as to strike terror into man (Ps. 2 : 5, Heb. 10 : 27, 31), but

it expresses also the greatness and energy of the wrath of God ; terrible, ^. <?., with all earnestness and zeal. Deut. 4 : 24, Heb. 12 : 29, Nahuin 1 : (1 The greatness and energy of God's love is the measure of His wrath. His wrath even testifies to His love, since it excludes every idea of indifference to evil on the part of God.

4. God is not only angry with actual sins committed in thought, word and deed, Rom. 2 : 8, 9, but also with inherited sin, original sin, the inborn evil desire. Eph. 2 : 3, Rom. 5 : 14. " Death reigned from Adam to Moses (although God did not reveal His will during that time through any law except that of conscience), even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression." This included all men, from Adam to Moses, to whom had not been given specially revealed law, such as God had given directly to Adam, and later through Moses to His people, and against which they sinned. This passage is therefore applied to children who have not yet sinned consciously, and yet are subject to the law of death, because the evil inclination is inherited by them. According to this teaching of the apostle, there is connected with sin inherited guilt.

II. The Pimislimeut of Sin.

1. As little as God's anger is passion, so little does His sentence of punishment against sin rest upon caprice. It is a just sentence ; for man through his apostasy from God forfeited life and merited death. Gen. 2 : 17, Rom. 6: 2:5, 1 Cor. 15: 50, Rom. 2: 5, 6, 11.

2. Therefore death, a word in which is embi-aced all the punishments of sin, passed upon the entire human race, without exception. Rom. 5: 12, Calvin says: " We, therefore, di-ead death, first, because in reference to the body it is a sort of destruction ; secondly, because

the soul feels the curse of God ; and lastly, because the cause of death is estraugemeiit from God. From tliis it follows that under the word death is comprehended all the misery into which Adam fell through his apostasy. For as soon as lie apostatized from God, tlie source of life, he fell from his earlier state, so that he had to feel that man's life without God is wretched, involved in ruin, and therefore not unlike death. For this reason tlie condition of man after the fall is itself rightly called death. The misery of body and soul during the earthly life is, at it were, the ante-chamber of death, until death engulfs him up completely."

8. We distinguish in the punishment of sin a threefold death : as "temporal" punishment, a) bodily, and h) spiritual death, and as " eternal" punishment, c) everlasting death.

a) Bodily death incliuled the sickness, wretchedness and want of the body until its final dissolution. Rom. 7 : 24, Gen. 3 : 19, Ps. 90 : 7.

b) Spiritual death is the inner state of separation of the natural man from the living God, and involves everything connected with it.

1. Reason is darkened, and therefore the natural man is incapable of rightly knowing God. Eph.4: 18, Rom. 1: 21,23, 1 Cor. 2: 14, Col. 1: 21.

2. His free will is lost, and man is a servant of sin. Rom. 1 : 28, John 8 : 34, Rom. 7 : 14, Eph. 2 : 3, 5.

3. From his heart peace has departed. Isa. 48 : 22, Ps. 38 : 3, Isa. 59 : 2.

c) Me7mal death consists in the torments which befall the sinner after this life in body and soul, and continue throughout all eternity. Luke 16 : 23, Matt. 10 : 28.

The awful torments o^ eternal death consist :

1. In the banishment from the presence of God. Matt. 25: 41, 2 Thess. 1: 9.

2. In the continual reproaches of conscience. Mark 9: 44.

3, In despair, that this condition will not come to an end throughout all eternity. Matt. 8 : 12; 1<S : ?A, Rev. 14: 11.

m. The Penal Law.

1. " Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the hook of the law, to do them." This is the penal law which God had announced and the legal punishment which followed on transgression, viz., sin. Deut. 27 : 2(), Gal. o : 10. " Cursed," i. e., excluded from the grace of God and delivered to destruction.

2. The punishment of sin is very certain. Gal. 0: 7, Ps. 50: 21, Heb. 9: 27.

IV. The Divine Judgments.

Definite divine judgments are set before us in Holy Scripture as proof of the punitive righteousness of (xod, and for our warning and exhortation.

h) Divine judgments as types of the final judgment.
