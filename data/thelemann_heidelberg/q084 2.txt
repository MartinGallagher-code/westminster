Thus : when, according to the command of Christ, it is declared and publicly testified to all and every believer, that whenever they receive the promise of the gospel by a true faith, all their sins are really forgiven them of God, for the sake of Christ's merits ; and, on the contrary, when it is declared and testified to all unbelievers, and such as do not sincerely repent, that they stand exposed to the wrath of God and eternal condemnation, so long as they are unconverted ; according to which testimony of the gospel God will judge them, both in this and the life to come.

I. The Opening of the Kingdom of Heaven Through Preaching.

The kingdom of heaven is opened and closed, not by the preaching of the law, but by the preaching of the Gospel, the proclamation of redemption through Jesus Christ and an invitation believingly to accept the same. " To all and every believer," i. e., not merely all in general ("to all"), but every individual ("every") believer is assured of the forgiveness of sins upon the basis of the merits of Christ as certainly as if he heard the statement from the very mouth of God. Ezek. 33 : 11, John 6 : 37, Luke 10 : 16.

n. The Closing of the Kingdom of Heaven Through Preaching.

Upon those who do not believe the Gospel when it is preached to them, eternal damnation will be visited as certainly as if they heard the very voice of God in the sermon. The announcement of the judgment of God in the sermon is to serve the purpose of securing their repentance and escape from the wrath of God. John 8 : 24, Matt. 3 : 7, 8.

TIL The Conflrmation of the Gospel.

The great day will make it clear that the opening and closing of the kingdom of heaven through the preaching of the Gospel is effectual not only for this life, but also for eternity. Rom. 2 : 16, Matt. 18 : 18.
