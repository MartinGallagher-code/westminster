Our death is not a satisfaction for our sins, but only an abolishing of sin, and a passage into eternal life.

I. Our Death Not a Punishment for Sin.

1. Death was appointed to man by God in the beginning as a penalty for sin. Gen. 2:17. Rom. 6 : 23, 1 Cor. 15 : 56, Heb. 9 : 27. That for the sinner temporal death is a penalty, i. e.., a punishment for sin, and yet does not pay, i. e., discharge the debt, but on the other hand is for him only the introduction to judgment and to eternal death, this it is that fills the natural man with dread of death, and that makes them ** through fear of death all their life time subject to bondage."

2. For believers, for whom Christ died and who live in Him, the relation to temporal death (of which only we treat here) has been changed. In accordance with the counsel and will of God, death retains its place as the end of the earthly life. 1 Cor. 15 : 26. Since Christ by His death has fully satisfied for all my sins, my death is no longer a satisfaction for my sins. Since in Christ I enjoy the forgiveness of sins, I cannot die in my sins. In this way death has been robbed of its sting and power, so that the fear of death no longer abides in my heart. Heb. 2: 14, 2 Tim. 1 : 10.

II. Our Death a Complete Deliverance From Sin.

1. Temporal death is a blessing to believers. For it is the end of all outward and inward distress and of all misery, which is their portion in the body of this death here on earth. On the contrary, to be compelled to remain in this vale of sin and misery until the time when heaven and earth shall be renewed, would be for them a burden so grevious as scarcely to be endured. Eom. 7 : 24. On the other hand it is not possible to enter upon eternal life in this mortal body, for flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorrupt'ion. 1 Cor. 15: 50, 2 Cor. 4: 10.

2. Temporal death is for believers an abolishing of sin.

a) By temporal death, i. e., by the separation of body and soul, the soul of the believer is fully and forever freed from the flesh, in which sin reigns. Rom. 7 : 18 ; 6 : 7, Heb. 4 : 10.

b) By temporal death we are entirely freed from sin and thereby death becomes for us at the same time the entrance upon eternal life and the glorious libertv of the children of God. Rom. 8: 21, John 5: 24;''l2: 26, 2 Cor. 5: 1.

3. Temporal death is to the body of the believer a sleep. John 11: 11, 1 Cor. 15: 18. For the soul, departure from the body is gain. Phil. 1 : 21. Therefore the believer often longs for death, 2 Cor. 5 : 2, and has a desire to depart. Phil. 1 : 23. Death has become to the believer, because of the death of Christ, a victory, which he approaches with joy and through which he passes in triumph. 1 Cor, 15 : do, 57, Acts 7 : ''^o, 59.
