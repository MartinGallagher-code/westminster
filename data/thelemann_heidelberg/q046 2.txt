heaven, and that he continues there for our interest, until he come

again to judge the quick and the dead.

1. After His resurrection, Christ communed with His disciples for forty days, appearing to them in various places and conversing with them concerning the

kingdom of God. xlcts 1 : 3. These forty days at the close of His redemptive work upon earth, correspond to the forty days in the desert at the beginning of His ministry. For the disciples this occasional intercourse with the Risen One, so different from the earlier daily association with Him, was a preparation for the time, when with their bodily eyes they should no longer see Him who was exalted to heaven.

2. Christ was taken up into heaven.

3. Christ, with respect to His human nature, entered heaven with the same body in which He became man, lived and suffered upon earth, died and rose, and which was now fully glorified. Otherwise His disciples could not have seen Him ascend into heaven. Mark 16 : 19, Luke 24 : 51, Acts 1 : 9, 10.

With respect to His divine nature, Christ, even after His incarnation, was and remained everywhere present, therefore also in heaven. John 3 : 13.

4. Evidence of the ascension of Christ.

a) The prophecies of the Old Testament : 1. In word, Psalm 47 : 5 ; 68 : 18, Col. 1 : 13 ; 2 : 15. 2. In type, Enoch, Gen. 5 : 24 ; Elijah, 2 Kings 2: 11 ; the high priest who entered into the holy of holies, Heb. 9: 24.

b) Christ Himself foretold it. John 3 : 13 , 16 : 28 ; 20: 17.

c) His disciples. (Peter) Acts 2 : 33, Eph. 4 : 10, 1 Peter 3 : 22.

d) His subsequent appearances in glory to Stephen, Acts 7 : 55; to Paul, Acts 9:3; 18 : 9 ; to John, Rev. 1:7.

e) The outpouring of the Holy Ghost which Christ had promised to send from the Father to His disciples. John 15 : 26, Acts 2 : 2.

5. Christ ascended into heaven " for our interest." John 14 : 3 ; 16 : 7.

THE HEIDELBERG CATECHISM. 179>

G. Christ continues in heaven until His return at the last day. Acts 3 : 21, Matt. 24 : 30, Col. 3 : 1, Phil. 3 : 20.

7. That we do not see the Savior who is exalted in heaven, does not perplex us, but it is a test of our faith. John 20 : 29, 2 Cor. 5 : 7, 1 Peter 1 : 7, 8.

8. Olevianus : " I believe that Christ ascended into heaven, i. e., I believe that Christ, who, with respect to His divinity, was at all times present in hea.ven, after He had fulfilled all things upon earth that were given Him to do, and for forty days had instructed His disciples concerning the truth of His resurrection and the kingdom of God, ascended into heaven with the same body, which is of the same substance with our body, which He took upon Himself from the substance (the flesh and blood) of the Virgin Mary, which hung upon the cross, died and was buried, and arose immortal, that He, I say, ascended with the same body and with His human soul from this earth into heaven, where all believers dwell after this life. John 14 : 2."
