The preaching of the holy gospel, and Christian discipline, or the excommunication out of the Christian Church ; by these two, the kingdom of heaven is opened to believers, and shut against unbelievers.

1. Christian discipline is not to be limited to the communion only, but extends further, and is exercised by the preaching of the Gospel and by the exclusion from the communion of the Church, either for a time or permanently (the lesser or the greater ban).

2. " The office of the keys." This designation is figurative, and is based upon the practice in connection

with the installation of earthly stewards or administrators who are entrusted with keys as a sign of the authority with which they are invested. The office of " the keys" in the Church rests upon the commission and authority which Christ gave first to Peter (Matt. 16 : 19), and in like manner to all the Apostles (Matt. 18 : 18, John 20 : 23), and thereby also to their successors in the office, in the government of the Church and congregation. Matt. 16 : 19 ; 18 : 18, John 20 : 22, 23.

3. The means of Church discipline can be only of a spiritual, and not of a civil character. 2 Cor. 10 : 4-6.
