That he might, by the power of his God-head, sustain, in his human nature, the burden of God's wrath ; and might obtain for and restore to us, righteousness and life.

1. Divine power is necessary so to bear the eternal wrath of God in time, that it may thereby be turned

away from the sins themselves. No one can do this who has not the power to overcome hell and the grave. Isa. 9 : 6.

2. In order to obtain righteousness and life for others it is necessary that one does not owe for himself obedience under the law, and he who would redeem others, must have power over his own life in order to yield it up. Isa. 53 : 12, John 10 : 18.

3. The righteousness and the life w^hich the Mediator obtains through his obedience and suffering must, in order to be of any benefit to the sinner, be made his own, must be imparted to him. This communication of the new life to man, who is dead in sins, can only be the w^ork of God, from whom proceedeth the Holy Ghost, who brings about spiritual resurrection and renewal.

4. The Mediator must be God and man in one person.

a) Because there can only be one Mediator, and because such a Mediator must be equally near to God and man.

b) That the divinity might support the humanity in the difficult work of mediation.

c) That the doing and suffering of humanity might be of full value.
