Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.

1. The prayer is known as " the Lord's Prayer," because the Lord Himself gave it ; as " our Father," in accordance with the words at the beginning,

2. The division of the prayer into three parts.

a) It begins with an address : Our Father, which art in heaven.

b) It contains six petitions.

(1) Hallowed be thy name.

(2) Thy kingdom come.

(3) Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.

(4) Give us this day our daily bread.

(5) And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

(6) And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

c) It closes with a doxology : " For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever," and with "Amen."

3. The first three petitions relate to God's honor, the next three to our needs. Of these, two have reference to our spiritual and one to our bodily needs. (The fourth petition refers to the body — bread ; the fifth to the soul — sin ; the sixth to body and soul — evil.) The petitions do not use the singular *' my," but the plural '* our" and " us," thereby partaking of the nature of intercession, and reminding us that we stand in a communion of prayer with all believers. Intercessory prayer enlarges the heart and smothers selfishness. (The first three j^etitions correspond to the first table, and the last three to the second table of the law.)

4. The sixth petition, " lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil," can not be divided into two petitions, as it forms, in thought as well as in construction, a whole.
