Because the justice of God requires that the same human nature, which hath sinned, should likewise make satisfaction for sin ; and one, Avho is himself a sinner, cannot satisfy for others.

1. The Mediator must be a true man.

a) If the justice of God is to be satisfied in behalf of man, the law which man has transgressed must be fulfilled, and the suffering to which man made himself liable as punishment for sin, must be endured. This can be done only by one who is really man and can suffer and die. Heb. 9 : 22.

b) The truth of God requires it, as expressed in the promise in Gen. 3 : 15.

c) Because the deliverer is to be the head of the new humanity, with which he can have compassion, because he experienced their misery in himself. Heb. 5 : 2.

2. The Mediator must be a righteous man.

a) Only a sinless man can stand before the holy and just God and enter into communion with Him. Isaiah 6 : 5.

b) Only a righteous, i. e., sinless man, who has not committed any sin and to whom no sinfulness adheres, can suffer the punishment for the sins of others.
