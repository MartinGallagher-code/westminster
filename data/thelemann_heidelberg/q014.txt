None ; for first, God will not punish any other creature for the sin which man hath committed ; and further, no mere creature can

sustain the burden of God's eternal wrath against sin, so as to deliver others from it.

1. No other creature can make satisfaction for us ; neither a man like us, nor a higher (angel) or a lower (animal) creature.

a) An angel cannot take the punishment upon himself, for he is a spiritual being. The punishment for sin must be endured in body and soul.

b) An animal cannot make satisfaction, for it does not have an immortal soul and cannot voluntarily take the punishment upon itself. The sacrifices of the old covenant were not a complete satisfaction for sin, because " in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins." Heb. 10 : 3, 4.

c) Satisfaction cannot be rendered by a man like ourselves, because such an one cannot pay for his own sins, much less for the sins of the entire race. For example, how can a man, who himself owes 5000 marks and cannot pay them, become security for the debt of another, for perhaps 500,000 marks, or offer to pay his debt.

2. A mere creature, i. e., one that is nothing more than a creature, cannot at all make satisfaction for our sins,

a) Because every creature of God owes obedience to Him for itself.

b) Because God will not punish any other creature for the sin of man. Gen. 2 : 17, Ezek. 18 : 4.

c) Because no mere creature can sustain the burden of God's eternal wrath, i. e., the weight of eternal damnation for himself, much less for others. Dent. 4 : 24, Ps. 130 : 3, Nahum 1 : 6.
