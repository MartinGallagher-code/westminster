That I, as sincerely as I desire the salvation of my own soul^ avoid and flee from all idolatry, sorcery, soothsaying, superstition, invocation of saints, or any other creatures, and learn rightly to know the only true God, trust in him alone, with humility and patience submit to him, expect all good things from him only ; love, fear, and glorify him with my whole heart ; so that I renounce and forsake all creatures, rather than commit even the least thing contrary to his will.
