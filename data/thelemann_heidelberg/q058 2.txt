Eternal life in the children of God is unfolded in two stages : Here on earth the beginning and foretaste, yonder in eternity the completion and fullness of happiness.

L The Beginning of Eternal Joy.

i. The life of believers is in its widest sense eternal^ inasmuch as it has its origin in the eternal merciful counsel of God and continues unto eternity. The

answer of the catechism, however, is formed from the standpoint of the temporal realization of God's gracious counsel and according to it eternal life takes its beginning in regeneration. 1 Peter 1 : 3, John 3 : 30, 1 John 3 : 2.

2. Here therefore we " feel " in our hearts only the beginning or a foretaste of " eternal joy." This feeling consists principally in the peace of God. John 14 : 27, Rom. 5 : 1.

At times the Lord favors His own with special feelings of eternal joy, as He did the Apostle Paul. 2 Cor. 12 : 2-4. He was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.

3. Eteral joy can not be complete here, because we are still in conflict with temptation, and subject to sin and all manner of afflictions and besetments inseparable from the bodily life. 1 Cor. 15 : 19, Rom. 8 : 24.

II. Perfect Salvation.

A. The nature of perfect salvation.

1. " After this life we shall inherit perfect salvation." Only then will it be our undisturbed possession. Matt. 25 : 34, 36. They shall go into eternal life. 1 Cor. 13 : 10, 1 Peter 1 : 7, 8.

2. Salvation after this life is incomprehensible to us now ; neither can it be described. In this life no eye hath seen it, nor ear heard it, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive. It will be a perfect salvation.

a) In respect to its constitution. For it consists : 1. In complete deliverance from all evil of body and soul. Rev. 21 : 4. 2. In the complete enjoyment of all good. Rev. 21 : 3.

b) In respect to its effect which will be the complete renewal, 1. Of the soul, — understanding (knowledge), 1

Cor. 18: 12; feeling, Ps. 16: 11; will, Ps. 110: 3. 2. Of the body, which in its members will be fully fitted for the service of God, Rev. 22 : 3.

c) In respect to its permanence. It is eternal. Isa. 35: 10.

3. Salvation will be the same for all believers ; but the glory different. Matt. 20 : 9, 10, 1 Cor. 15 : 41.

4. But will not eternal salvation be tedious ? By no means ; for " eternal joy " will neither weary nor satiate. Gazing into the mysteries of the works and the ways and the Kingdom of God, as well as blessed intercourse with the countless hosts of the children of God, will afford the richest diversity of occupation ; and the rest of the children of God will not consist in inactivity.

For B. Tlie purpose of salvation is the eternal adoration of God. The highest and noblest activity for a person renewed after the image of God. Rev. 7 : 9, 10, 15. III. The Comforting Certainty.

1. The article concerning eternal life is a " comfort " only to me when I am certain of this life. The evidences of it are : a) Living faith, 1 John 5 : 10, 11 ; ^) A holy life, 1 John 3 : 3 ; c) Heartfelt longing, Ps. 42 : 2.
