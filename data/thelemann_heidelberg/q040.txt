Because with respect to the justice and truth of God, satisfaction for our sins could be made no otherwise than by the death of the Son of God.

1. In Relation to the Justice of God.

1. In accordance with the righteousness of God the sinner had to die. Because Christ appeared for us, ^. e., in our stead before the judgment of God, it was necessary to execute God's justice upon Him, and He had to die, thus paying the jDenalty, i. e., rendering satisfaction for us. Gen. 2 : 17, Rom. 6 : 23 ; 1 : 32, Matt. 20 : 28, Rom. 5 : 8.

n. In Relation to the Trutli of God.

That the Son of God was to die for our sins, liad been foretold of God by word and types in the Old Testament, and on account of the truth of God these prophecies must be fulfilled. Isa. 53 : 10, Luke '24 : 26.

a) By word. Ps. 18 : 4,5; 22 : 15, Isa. 53 : 8.

b) In types. The sacrifice of Isaac, Gen. 22 ; all the sacrifices (Heb. 9 : 9-14), especially the sacrifice on the great day of atonement (Heb. 10 : 12, 14) ; the paschal lamb (1 Cor. 5: 7).

III. For Whom Christ Died.

The power of Christ's death becomes manifest only in God's chosen ones, i. e., true believers.
