True faith is not only a certain knowledge, whereby I hold for truth all that God has revealed to us in his word, but also an assured confidence, which the Holy Ghost works by the Gospel in my heart ; that not only to others, but to me also, remission of sin, everlasting righteousness, and salvation, are freely given by God, merely of grace, only for the sake of Christ's merits.

In ordinary speech we distinguish between believing anything and believing in a person. The former has reference to holding anything for truth, the latter to trust in a person. Merely to hold for truth what some one has stated is blind faith. To a true faith in divine things belongs above all the knowledge of the truth and conviction of the same because God has revealed it. Thus we distinguish also in true faith, 1. The knowledge and acceptance of the divine truth, that we believe what has been revealed to us ; and 2. Such confidence in God and personal surrender to Him that we believe on Him (place our confidence in Him and enter into His fellowship).

I. True Faith is a Certain Knowledge.

A) Know^ledge.

1. If we are to believe on God, we must first know Him as the true God ; what we are to apprehend we must first know ; but we can only learn to know and to apprehend the true God when He reveals Himself to us, i. e., manifests and makes Himself known to us. He has revealed Himself to us in creation. Rom. 1 ; 19, 20. But that we have not only an almighty, but also a merciful God, who saves the sinner, we know only from the revelation in His Word, and through Jesus Christ,

His only begotten Son. 2 Tim. o : 15, 16, John 9 : 35, 36.

2. A certain knowledge, in the Latin translation of the Catechism " certa notitia," does not refer so much to a particular kind of knowledge, but to an exact,definite, firm knowledge, even as the revelation of God in His Word is clear and definite. 2 Peter 1 : It), John 4 : 42, compare also V. 10, " If thou knewest the gift of God," etc.

B) Assent or Accp:ptange.

1. The human understanding can search the Word of God and learn to know it as any other book, but it attains only a knowledge of the letter, and will never come to the knowledge of the truth of itself, without the working of the Holy Ghost. 1 Cor. 2 : 14. But through the testimony of the Holy Ghost we come to the conviction that God's Word is the truth; we not merely recognize God's Word, but also hold it as true, recognize it as the truth, assent to it and approve of it, and thereby become free from the doubts which the world and our own flesh excite against the Word of God. 1 Cor. 2 : 13, John 8 : 32, 1 John 2 : 27.

2. It belongs also to a true faith that one not merely accepts and holds as true this and that which may be agreeable to one in the Word of God, but everything that God has revealed in it. The old Reformed principle is, the Word and the entire Word, and nothing but the Word. Acts 24 ; 14, 1, Paul, believe all things which are written in the law and the prophets. For us there is yet to be added what has been written by the evangelists and apostles.

n. True Faith is a Hearty Confidence.

1. "Not alone" — " but also." This indicates that true faith consists in knowledge and confidence. The expression " not alone" does not put a slight estimate upon knowledge, but represents it as of equal worth with

confidence. At the same time it expresses the idea that knowledge, inchiding recognition, does not in itself constitute true faith. That there necessarily belongs to it also an acknowledgment and acceptance of the truth and a trustful surrender to Him who is the truth. 1 Cor. 13 ; 2.

2. As we can not attain to true knowledge and acceptance of the revealed truth of ourselves, but only through the Holy Ghost, so also the confidence which is hearty, i. e., coming from the heart and filling the whole heart, thus also certain and firm, can only be wrought in us by the Holy Ghost. This is accomplished as well through the power of the Holy Ghost residing in the Word of God itself as in the experience (John 7 : 17) which we acquire under His direction. " Not only to others, but to me also," points to the fact that our relation of faith to God must be a personal one. The knowledge and the experience of salvation wrought by the Holy Ghost brings the certainty of salvation which alone gives to the heart perfect comfort, rest, peace and joy in life and in death.

a) Hearty Confidence. — Rom. 10: 10, Heb. 11 : 1, John 20: 29, 2 Cor. 4 : 18. Among all the examples of faith in Holy Scripture, Abraham stands at the head, the father of all who believe (Rom. 4 : 11). Rom. 4: 20, 21, Heb. 11: 17-19.

b) Which the Holy Ghost works in us. — Matt. 16: 17, Acts 16: 14, 1 Cor. 12: 3.

c) Through the Gospel. — Rom. 1 : 16 ; 10 : 17.

d) Assurance of Salvation (to me also). — Eph. 3 : 12, 1 Tim. 1 : 16, 2 Tim. 1 : 12, Rom. 8 : 28, 38, 39, 2 Peter 1 : 10.

3. His benefits (Ques. 20) which we receive and accept in true faith are :

a) Forgiveness of Sins.— Matt. 9 : 2, Ps. 103 : 1, 3.

b) Everlasting Righteousness.— Dan. 9- 24 Acts 13 : 39, Gal. 2 : 20.

c) Eternal Salvation. — John G : 47 • 10 • 28 • 12 : 26, 2 Tim. 4 : 7, 8. , . ,

4. The ground upon which rests the impartation of these benefits is, 1. His grace, and 2. The merit of Christ. In that it happens merely of, i. e., (pure, free) grace and only for the sake of Christ's merits, all personal merit, also a possible merit of faith itself, is absolutely excluded and the recognition of this actual relation in true faith is included.

a) Merely of Grace.— Eph. 1 : 7 ; 2 : 8.

b) Only for the Sake of Christ's Merits. - Eom. 3 : 24, Eph. 2 : 9.

5. The end of faith is to receive Christ wholly and alone in the heart and to retain Him in it constantly. There is a growth, steps of faith. Rom. 1 : 17, Col. 1 : 11, Eph. 4: 15; 4 : 13. There is a weak faith and a strong faith. A weak faith may also be true faith, when it is otherwise of the right kind. A fire is not at once a bright blazing flame, but it often starts with a single spark. Mark 9 : 24, Luke 17 : 5, Phil. 1 : 6, Heb. 12 : 2. But from weak faith is to be distinguished an objectionable faint-hearted faith. Matt. 14 : 31, Luke 24 : 25. Paul received a strong faith. Acts 9 : 20, 22. It is a strong faith that overcomes the world and death. Acts 6 : 10, 1 John 5 : 4, 1 Cor. 15 : ^^. The strong faith which characterized the martyrs of early Christianity and of the time of the Reformation is the result of the certainty of election in Christ Mark 13 : 22, 2 Peter 1 : 10.

6. Dangers threaten true faith from all sides, from within and from without.

From within (from the flesh, through the temptation of the devil) arises doubt. It overthrew the faith of

Eve with the words " Did God indeed say ?" James 1:0.

From without the worhl, steeped in unbelief and superstition, assails faith. It derides true faith as childish. But the Lord said (Matt. 11 : 25), I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, etc. Matt. 18 : 3. True faith is said to be in conflict with enlightenment. This is said by those of whom the Scriptures say that their understanding is darkened ''' '=' '•' through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart. Eph. 4: 18, 2 Cor. 4: 4. True faith is said to be irreconcilable with culture. Then culture is false. And so it is. That which the world commonly calls culture is directed merely toward that which is earthly both in body and in spirit and leaves the heart empty. 2 Cor. 3 : 18. To be transformed into the image of Christ who is the image of God, that is the highest culture. It is said that true faith offends against the spirit of the times. What the latter is, a prophet of the world (Goethe) has excellently said " that which you call the spirit of the times is in reality the spirit of the men themselves." This Zeitgeist changes with the people and the times. 2 Cor. 3 : 18, Heb. 13 : 8, Phil. 3 : 20, Heb. 12 : 28.

We are not to allow ourselves to be led away, or to be frightened from true faith. Zwingli says, " Not to fear is the best defence." Scripture warns and admonishes. 2 Peter 3: 17, 1 Tim. 1 : 18, 19. We also have firm ground under our feet; the others have not. John 4 : 22, Heb. 10 : 39, Prov. 18 : 10. Emperor William I. of Germany (died March 9, 1888) confessed on his death bed : The name of the Lord has been my help.
