By the "communion of saints" is not meant the church itself, of which the former article treated, but it is intended to set forth the relation of the living^

members of the Church to Christ their Head on the one hand, to their living fellow-members on the other. As members the}^ have a right to all that Christ has secured for them by His incarnation ; as fellow-members they owe certain duties to all who like themselves are redeemed by the blood of Christ and are ingrafted into Him by a true faith. The relation to Christ the Head (Eph. 5 : 23) and to their fellow-members may be compared to the community of goods which exists between man and wife in the marital union.

By " saints" are not meant the mere external members of the Church, neither those who are canonized or regarded as saints by the papacy, nor those who pretend that they are pious and despise others (Luke 18: 9), but true "believers" who in Christ are separated from the world and are regenerated by the Spirit of God. Such are spoken of by the Scriptures in many places as " saints" {e. g., Col. 3 : 12, Eph. 1:1; 6 : 18, Phil. 1 : 1.

I. The Communion with Christ and His Gifts— a Comfort to us.

1. Believers are "members" of Christ. Eph. 5 : 30. They are thereby also " members," i. e., united with each other. 1 John 1 : 3.

2. " All and every one who believes," i. e., all together and each one in particular. The possession and enjoyment of the gifts of grace as well as the obligation of mutual love belongs to all in general and to each one in particular. Every one who believes, even the one who has only the beginnings of faith, enjoys the fullest measure of privilege in Christ fully. Every believer, whether he possesses little or much, is indebted to the other members according to the measure of his ability.

3. The communion with Christ, i. e., the personal relation of faith to Him is the ground upon which

we have a claim and share in His riches and gifts. Col. 2 : 11), Rom. 8 : 32.

a) Christ's riches, i. e., everything that is Christ's own, belongs also to those who believe on Him. 1 Cor. ;] : 22. His Father (John 20 : 17), His love, (John 17 : 28-26), His name (Rev. 3 : 12), His merits (Rom. 4: 24), His inheritance, heaven and His glory (Rom. 8:17, John 12 : 26 ; 17 : 24), are ours.

b) Christ's gifts are : Forgiveness of sins, righteousness and eternal life. Eph. 1 : 3, John 1 : 16.

4. It is a great comfort to us poor sinners that our Lord is so rich, and that we participate in all His gifts. 2 Cor. 8 : 9. But of the right that we have to Christ and H's riches, grows the duty of more and more complete consecration to Him in body and soul. 1 Cor. 3: 23, 2 Tim. 2: 11, 12.

n. The Communion with all Believers— an Admonition for us.

1. "Every one must know it to be his duty," i. e., know that he is under obligations to other members, and is to act in accordance therewith. Gal. 3 : 28, 1 Cor. 12 : 26.

2. " Gifts" includes all that we have, and this reminds us that we do not possess anything of ourselves, but that everything is given to us of God. 1 Cor. 4 : 7.

3. The gifts include both the temporal and spiritual.

a) Temporal. Rom. 12 : 1, 3, Isa. 58 : 7, Matt. 25 : 35, 36.

b) Spiritual. 1 Thes. 5: 11, 1 John 5 : 16.

4. Every one is to "employ his gifts, for the advantage and salvation of other members." What God has given to each one, both tem})orally and spiritually. He has given not merely for each one's own possession and enjoyment, but also for the use and service of his brother. Tiiis condition is fulfilled when each one faithfully discharges his duty, and in addition contributes to the needs of others accordino; to his ability. 2 Cor. 8 : 2, 3, 4, 14.

5. This is to be done " readily and cheerfully," i. e.,

a) Not from constraint. 2 Cor. 9 : 7.

b) Not from impure motives, as did the Pharisees, who on that account had their reward. Matt. 6 : 3.

c) But from love, which is the bond of brotherly fellowship. Col. 3: 14, Gal. 6 : 10.

6. With reference to the duty we owe to all believers, we need to be constantly admonished, since by nature we are so deeply immersed in selfishness, which is overcome with so much difficulty. Phil. 2: 4.

Examples. The first Christian Church in Jerusalem. Acts 2 : 44, 45 ; 4 : 32-37. It was not social democracy, but Christian socialism, a) Every one was free to sell his goods, or to retain the money which he received for them. Acts 5 : 4 ; b) Provision was made for the poorer members of the Church according to their necessities. Acts 2 : 45. The difference between a Christian and a social democrat may be thus briefly expressed : The Christian says, " What is mine, is yours ;" the social democrat says, " What is yours, is mine." The alms of the apostolic churches which the Apostle Paul gathered. Acts 11 : 29, Pom. 15 : 26. The community of goods of the first Christians, of whom the heathen said : " Behold, how they love one another !"
