I. The Objection.

1. On the part of those who teach justification by works (not only in the Romish Church), it is objected that if justification were not secured before God by good works, and it were possible by faith to become free from

sill and its punishment so easily, men would become " careless and profane," i. e., they would rest in a state of false security and presumption.

2. It cannot be denied that there may be and that there are among us, people who turn the grace of God into lasciviousness. Of this, however, the doctrine is not the cause. The ground thereof is to be found in the fact that such persons do not have true and living faith.

3. The same plea was already made to the Apostle Paul and refuted by him. Rom. 3: 8, 31 ; 6: 1, 2.

There were also persons in the Apostolic churches who sought to abuse this doctrine. Jude v. 4.

II. The Defence.

1. It is impossible that the doctrine of justification by faith should have a tendency to make men wicked. For those who are justified by " true faith " are " ingrafted into Christ," and thereby become partakers of His spirit and life, the spirit of sanctification and a sanctified life. Gal. 5: 24, 1 John 3: 9, Matt. 7: 18.

2. As good fruit is the necessary product of a good tree, so from justification by faith there necessarily proceed good works, as " fruits of thankfulness." We, therefore, do not in the least repudiate good works, but only their meritoriousness, and that upon the basis of the Scriptures. It is also evident that only those " good works " have a moral value in the sight of God which proceed from love to Him and from thankfulness for the justification freely offered and embraced by faith, over against " good works," performed to gain the favor of God, from mercenary motives, and, therefore, in reality from selfishness. John 15 : 5, 8, 2 Cor. 5 : 14, 15, Tit. 3 : 7, 8.
