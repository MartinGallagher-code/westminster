From the holy Gospel, which God himself revealed first in Paradise ; aud afterwards published by the Patriarchs aud Prophets, and was pleased to represent it by the shadows of sacrifices, and the other ceremonies of the law ; and lastly has accomplished it by his only begotten Son.

I What is Meant by the Holy Gospel.

1. As humanity could not evolve a Mediator out of itself, neither did it choose or appoint Jesus Christ, the Son of God, to this office, nor can man of himself know the way to life. God must reveal it to him. God gave Christ to man and made preparation for His appearance by word and act in the history of the old covenant. This was not done in secret, but amongst God's people, to whom it was proclaimed, in order that when the Mediator came, the Scriptures which contained all these revelations, might testify of Him and for Him. John 5 : 39. " They are they which testify of me," viz., the Scriptures of the Old Testament. In the new covenant is portrayed the fulfillment through Christ, and it in turn confirms the truth of the proclamation in the old covenant.

God Himself is the originator of the Gospel, not simply in Paradise (where He revealed it direct to our first parents), but also in the case of the patriarchs and prophets (through whom it was published), and in connection with the sacrifices and the law of the old covenant (through which He was pleased to represent it), as well as in the new covenant, where He accomplished it.

The holy Scriptures of the old as well as of the new covenant, as the record of these revelations, are equally

of divine orio;in. They are inspired by God. 2 Tim. o : 16, 2 Peter 1 : 21. Upon this rests the acceptance of the entire Scripture as divine, and its unconditional authority in the true Church of Christ.

2. The Gospel means good news, gladsome message. But not every glad message, e.g., that a beloved relative has recovered from sickness away from home, or that a large inheritance has fallen to one, is gospel as understood here. To distinguish it from all other messages, it is called the holy Gospel, and carries with it the glad message or proclamation of tlie Mediator between God and man, the Redeemer and Savior. Isa. 52 : 7.

This glad message was revealed by God in the Old Testament through proclamation in prophecies, and representation in types. In the New Testament it is found in the fulfillment of all this by Jesus Christ, in His person and work. The Gospel is, therefore, in the old covenant the glad message of the Savior who was to come ; in the New Testament it is the glad message of the Savior who has come. Zech. 9 : 9, Luke 2 : 10, 11.

3. Law and Gospel.

A) Law and Gospel agree in this that both are one revelation from God, and that in both the being, will and works of God are treated of On the other hand, they are distinguished from each other in the following points :

a) The law was impressed upon the heart of man in creation, and was, therefore, by nature familiar to all. Rom. 2 : 15. The Gospel is not known by nature, but it has been revealed from heaven to the Church of the old and new covenant through the Mediator Christ. Matt. 11 : 27 ; 10 : 17, John 1 : 18.

b) The law teaches what we ought to be and what we should render unto God ; but it does not impart the strength to oifer God what is due Him, nor does it indicate the way by which we might attain this ability.

On the other hand, the Gospel teaches in what way we may become such persons as the law demands. Matt. 18 : 23, Luke 10 : 28, Mark 4 : 26.

c) The law promises life to those who are perfect in the same. Lev. 18 : 5, Matt. 19 : 17. The Gospel promises life to those who are justified throug-h faith in Christ. And yet they do not contradict each other. The law is the letter which killeth, and is a ministration of death. It is the office which preacheth condemnation. By letter is to be understood the outward proclamation and bare knowledge of what is to be done. Rom. 3 : 23 ; 4 : 15, 2 Cor. 3 : 7, 9. The Gospel is a ministration of life. It is the office which preacheth righteousness, and it is spirit. Rom. 1 : 17, 2 Cor. 3 : 8,9.

B) With reference to the relation between the law and the Gospel, Olevianus says :

" The law is a principle which God has implanted in nature, and has repeated and renewed in the commandments, in which He presents to us as in a handwriting what we are bound to do and what to leave undone, viz., a perfect inner and outer obedience ; and He promises eternal life on the condition that we keep the law of God perfectly all our life. But on the other hand, eternal damnation is threatened if we do not keep it, but transgress it in one or more points. Deut. 27: 26. After the law has once been transgressed, there is no promise that our sin will be forgiven through its help, i. e., through the works of the law, but the sentence of condemnation follows immediately. But the Gospel, or the glad tidings, is a truth concerning which the wisest men have known nothing by nature. It has been revealed from heaven. In it God does not make a demand of us, but He offers and gives to us the righteousness which the law demands of us, viz., the perfect obedience of the suffering and death of Jesus Christ, whereby all our sins and condemnation with

which the law threatens us, are pardoned and blotted out. Rora. 5, Gal. o. God gives us in the Gospel the forgiveness of sins, not under the condition that we keep the law, but as a free gift through faith in Jesus Christ. Although we have never kept the law, and even now cannot keep it perfectly, He has nevertheless forgiven us our sins and offers eternal life. John 1:17, Rom. 8 : 8, 4, Gal. 8 : 12-15."

4. The effects of the Gospel are :

a) Faith. Rom. 10 : 17, 2 Cor. 3 : 8, Rom. 1 : 16.

b) Through faith comijlete conversion, justification, and renewal of man.

5. The certainty and truth of the Gospel are confirmed :

a) By the testimony of the Holy Ghost.

b) By the predictions of the prophets in the Old and their fulfillment in the New Testament.

c) By the miracles through which the teaching of the Gospel is confirmed.

d) Through the testimony of evangelical truth itself, in that it alone shows the way by which we may escape sin and death, and in that it alone offers a real comfort to the troubled conscience.

n. The Progressive Communication of the Gospel in the Old

Testament.

The communication of the Gospel in the Old Testament passed through three stages :

1. The immediate revelation of God to our first jiarents in Paradise, the so-called protevangelinm. 2. The announcement to the patriarchs and prophets in ])romises and prophecies, o. The representation in types (persons, acts and customs).

The communications and representations which arose in these several ways were always adapted to the circumstances of the persons and the relations of the times, and can only be rightly known and understood in the

light of the New Testament ; even as one can infer from the shadow the body which casts it, but can really only know the latter when it appears. Thus all that points to the appearance of Christ in the flesh in the Old Testament, is designated as shadow in the New Testament. Col. 2: 17.

In the entire New Testament great stress is laid upon these pre-announcements, and frequent reference is made to the words " that the Scripture might be fulfilled." Christ Himself appeals to that which was spoken of Him. Luke 24 : 44.

A) The protevangelium in Paradise.

Thus are designated the Avords which God spake to the serpent. Gen. 3 : 15. In the nature of the circumstances this enmity first manifested itself between the posterity of the woman (men in general) and the offspring of the serpent. But as in tlie temptation and in the judgment pronounced against the first sin, not only the animal, the serpent, is involved, but also the one whose instrument it was in bringing sin into the world, his power must be destroyed if sin is again to be put out of the way. Thus this word becomes a promise of the future Redeemer, the one who bruises the serpent's head. In this sense Eve also apprehend'^d it and said at the birth of her first son (the first born of man) : I have gotten the man, the Lord. Gen. 4:1. But she was disappointed. The first born of man did not become a deliverer, but a murderer. The j^romised seed of the woman is " the Son of Man" who appeared in the time appointed by God. Gal. 4 : 4, Matt. 1 : 18-20.

Christ, the Son of Man, has bruised the serpent's head, i. e., has overcome the devil and in behalf of the children of God deprived him of his power. 1 John 3 : 8. As the struggle in Paradise commenced with temptation, so also in the wilderness, according to the counsel and will of God. Matt. 4:1.

64 THE HEIDELBERCx CATECHISM.

The Son of Man i-epulsed the three-fokl attack. Luke 4 : 13. "And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season," but not for ever. Thereafter he contended against the Son of Man through his instruments, the Scribes and Pharisees. John 8 : 44. " Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do." Through them he approached the crucified one at the end in the same manner as in the first temptation. Matt. 27 : 39. Satan also found an instrument in Judas, the gifted disciple, against the Son of Man, as he had found one against our first parents in Paradise in the crafty serpent. Luke 22 : 3. The old serpent bruised the heel of the Son of Man, brought Him to the cross, to death, but not to fiill ; for He was indeed tempted in all points, yet without sin (Heb. 4: 15), until He exclaimed in His expiring breath : It is finished. Thereby the victory over the devil was gained, and in spite of the bruised heel, the head of the old serpent was crushed.

B) Proclamation of the Gospel through promises and prophecies.

1. A ^progressive development characterizes the proclamation of the Gospel before Christ. The nearer the time of fulfillment approaches, the more clear and definite does it become, from the protevangelium in Paradise until Micah and Malachi, the last proj^hets of the Old Testament. We may picture this progress by concentric circles passing from the widest to the narrowest, the centre of which is Christ, the fulfillment.

2. In the protevangelium God had promised (even if not brought forth in tlie ordinary manner, except as the Seed of the woman) that the Redeemer should come forth from humanity, should be man. In the succeeding ])romises, the circles from which He was to be expected are drawn more and more narrow.

a) 8hem.— Among the three great branches into which the human family was separated after the flood, the Semites are the ones among whom the Redeemer was to appear. Gen. 9 : 27. This was fulfilled in the first place according to the promise of God, Ex. 29 : 44, 4r), by the dwelling of the Lord's glory over the ark of the covenant in the tabernacle and the temple. Ex. 40: 84, 35, 1 Kings 8: 11. Secondly, it was accomplished by the appearance of the Son of God in the flesh amongst the children of Israel. John 1 : 14, Col. 2 : 9. Finally, it will be fulfilled in greatest sjdendor after the renovation of heaven and earth. Rev. 21 : 1, 3.

b) Abraham. — Among the Semitic tribes, the children of Israel are the people out of whom the Redeemer was to come, and herein are the marvellous ways of God manifested, in that He did not choose for Himself an existent people, but (that no flesh, whether of the progenitor or people, might boast) gave Isaac to Abraham and Sarah, when both were old, and created His chosen people for Himself. Gen. 26 : 4. The people, i. e., the descendants of Abraham, are in the first place the bearers of the promise, which is finally fulfilled in Christ. Gal. 3 : 16, Matt. 1 : 1. The same promise that was given to Abraham is repeated to Isaac and to Jacob. Gen. 26 : 4; 28: 14. The fulfillment is also in Christ. Rom. 9 : 5.

6') JuDAH. — Among the people of Israel, it is the tribe of Judali which God designates through the blessing of Jacob. Gen. 49 : 10. The fulfillment of this promise in Christ is referred to in Rev. 5 : 5. When Jesus was born, Herod, who was not of the tribe of Judah, but an Edomite, a descendant of Esau, was king at Jerusalem.

d) David. —In the tribe of Judah, it is the house, the family of David, which God chooses. 1 Sam. 16: 6-13. The promise which God gave to David later

(2 Sam. 7: 12-14) referred first to Solomon ; but it was finally fulfilled in its completeness in Christ. Matt. 22 : 42; i : 1, Acts 2 : 30-32, Rom. 1 : 1-3, Heb. 1 : o.

e) In this narrowest circle, to which the }H'ophecies of all the succeeding prophets are limited, again two special indications are given, the nearer the time of fulfillment approaches.

1. Christ was not only to come from the house of David, but he was to be born in Bethlehem, the city of David, even when David's descendants should no longer be living there. Micah 5 : 2, Matt. 2 : 4-6, Luke 2 : 4-7. In order that this promise might be fulfilled, according to the divine government of the world, the mightiest ruler u])on the earth gave forth a command that set the whole Koman empire in motion.

2. The Redeemer was to be born a son of a virgin. In Isaiah 7 : 14 the prophet prophesies of this son of a virgin. Matt. 1 : 18-23, Luke 1 : 27, 31, 34.

After the announcement made by the prophet Isaiah, prophecy reverts again to the first promise of the seed of the woman.

3. God gave the promise of the Redeemer to the patriarchs, to whom, in the widest sense, belong (exclusive of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the ))rogenitors of God's people) also the earlier ancestors from Adam until Noah, the founders of the human race, and Shem, and later David, the founder of the royal family. Through them the announcement was made to their posterity. The prophets, to whom in the widest sense also Moses (John h: 46), Samuel and David (Acts 3: 24 ; 2 : 30) belong, prophesied, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and from the points of view of their times, of the future Redeemer. Both the great proi)hets, Elijah and Elisha, who left no writings, through their typical activity and their miracles prophesied of Him and pointed toward Him.

a) The first prophecy concerning Christ from human lips, which has been transmitted to us by Moses, is in a remarkable manner that of a heathen prophet, Balaam. He spake not by his own will, but against his will, impelled and driven by the Holy Ghost, when he was bribed to curse Israel. Num. 24 : 17, There shall come a star out of Jacob and a sceptre shall rise out of Israel. This is fulfilled in the star of the (likewise heathen) wise men from the East (Matt. 2 : 2) and in the designation of Christ as the morning star (2 Peter 1 : 19, Rev. 22: 16).

Moses himself prophesied of Christ. Deut. 18 : 15, 18, 19. The fulfillment of his prophecy we see in Christ. John G : 14, Mark 9 : 7, Acts 3 : 22, John 7 : 16; 8: 26.

b) In the Psalms. — There are those of a special character which contain references to Christ, and are therefore called Messianic : 1. Of Christ's person and office, Ps. 3, 110, 128; 2. Of Christ's suffering and glory, Ps. 2, 8, 16, 22, 68 ; 3. Of the propagation of the gospel, Ps. 19, 40, 45, 47, 50, 72, 78, 93, 97, 98.

c) All the prophets prophesied of Christ, and in their writings are contained numerous, more or less distinct (direct or indirect), prophecies of Him. Luke 24: 27, Acts 10 : 43.

1. Isaiah. — The church father Augustine already called this prophet, on account of his many and distinct prophecies of Christ, the " evangelist of the old covenant." The most important passages are : Isa. 7 : 14, of the son of a virgin (Matt. 1 : 18, 22, 23, Luke 1 : 27, 31, 34) ; Isa. 9 : 2, 6, 7, of the light in the darkness and the prince of peace (Luke 1 : 79 ; 2 : 7, 11, John 3 : 16, Gal. 4 : 4, Luke 1 : 32) ; Isa. 11 : 1, 2, of the rod out of the stem of Jesse (Matt. 2 : 23 ; 12 : 17, 18) ; Isa. 40 : 3, of the forerunner of Christ (Matt. 3 : 3); Isa. 40: 11, of the shepherd (John 10: 11, 12);

Isa. 42 : 1-4, of the meek servant of God (Matt. 12 : 17-21) ; Isa. 53, of the suffering servant of God, the Redeemer. The fulfiUment of each verse in this entire chajDter may he found in the New Testament : V. 1 — John 12 : 38 ; v. 2— John 19 : 5 ; v. 3— Mark t) : 12, Matt. 2G : 67 ; 27 : 30, 41 ; v. 4— Matt. 8 : 17 ; v. o— 1 Peter 2 : 24 ; v. 0—1 Peter 2 : 25 ; v. 7~Mark 14 : 16, John 1 : 29, Acts 8 : :V2 ; v. 8— Acts 8 : :]3, 35 ; V. 9— John 19 : 38-42, 1 Peter 2 : 22 ; v. 10— ]\Iatt. 20: 28; v. 11—1 Peter 3: 18; v. 12— Mark 15: 28, Luke 23 : 28.

2. Jeremiah. — Jer. 23 : 5, 6, of the Lord who is our righteousness (1 Cor. 1 : 30).

3. EzEKiEL. — Ezek. 34 : 23, of the good shepherd (John 10: 12).

4. Daniel. — Dan. 9 : 25, 26, of Christ the prince (Mark 1 : 15) ; Dan. 7 : 13, 14, of the Son of Man (Luke 21: 27; 1: 33).

5. HosEA. — Hos. 6 : 3, of the morning (Titus 3 : 4).

6. Joel — Joel 3 : 1-5, of the Spirit that will be sent (John 14 : 26 ; 16 : 7, Acts 2 : 16, 33).

7. Amos. — Amos 9 : 11, of the restorer of the fallen tabernacle of David (Acts 15 : 15, 16).

8. Obadiah. — Obad. v. 21, of salvation upon Mount Zion (Luke 22: 39, Acts 1 : 12).

9. Jonah. — Jonah 2 : 1, in the whale's bellv (Matt. 12: 39,40).

10. MicAH. — Micah 2: 13, of the one that led captivity captive (Mark 16: 4, 6, Eph. 4 : 8).

11. Nahum. — Nahum 2 : 1, of the messenger of peace (Luke 2 : 14, John 14 : 27).

12. Habakkuk. — Hah. 2: 3, of the fulness of time and the certain coming of the promised one (Mark 1 : 15, Gal. 4:4).

13. Zephaniah. — Zeph. 3 : 9, of the cheerful message (Titus 3 : 4) ; Ze])h. 3 : 15, of the king of Israel (John 1: 49).

14. Haggai.— Hag. 2 : 8, of the consolation of the Gentiles (Matt. 5: 4, Acts 8: 89; 10: 44, 45; 11 • 18; 18: 48).

15. Zechariah.— Zech. 18 : 1, of the open fountain (John 4: 13; 7: 37, 88).

16. Malachi.— Mai. 8: 1, of the angel of the covenant (John 2: 14-16, Heb. 8: (>, 8-10; 9: 15).

C) Representation of the gospel through types in the Old Testament.

1. The Gospel is Typified. — As the announcements of the prophets are prophecies of Christ in word, so also are the types prophecies in persons and things (acts, occurrences, arrrangements or customs). The types in the Old Testament are pre-representations of Christ, but only in individual features. The comparison and interpretation must be made in the light and by the help of the New Testament. The method of interpreting the type, however, dare not be arbitrary or degenerate into play-work. That which was ty])ical of Christ in the Old Testament, we recognize from the relations or indications in the New Testament. Heb. 8 : 5, Col. 2 : 17.

2. We distinguish personal and material types. Only the most important are here referred to.

a) Personal Types.

1. Adam.— Rom. 5 : 14, 1 Cor. 15 : 22, 47, 49. ^ 2. Melchizedek.— Gen. 14 : 18-20, Heb. 6 : 207:4. The points of likeness : His mysterious descent and his entire appearance ; his name " king of righteousness" and " king of Salem," i. e., of peace ; his office as king and priest ; his gifts, bread and wine ; he is higher than Abraham and blesses him.

3. Isaac at the Sacrifice.— Gen. 22. The points of likeness : He is the beloved and only son of his father ; during the three days of the journey he was to Abraham as dead ; the conversation with' his father

(Matt. 2G : 31), 42) ; he is bound and laid upon the wood (1 Peter 2 : 24) ; his silence and his resignation ; the word of the Lord to Abraham (Horn. 8: 32).

4. Joseph. — Gen. 37-45. The points of likeness : He is the favorite son (the chosen) of his father ; he walks in obedience to liiin ; on this account he is hated by his brothers ; he receives revelations of his future glory ; he is sold by his brothers, at the suggestion of Judah, and degraded to a slave ; he endures the temptation ; he is falsely accused and condemned without judgment and justice ; he meets two evil-doers, one of whom is pardoned ; he is in a subterranean dungeon as in a grave, forgotten of men ; he is elevated ; he is called the governor of the land who ])rovides his brothers and strangers (Jews and Gentiles) with bread that they may live ; he forgives his brothers (Luke 23 : 34) ; his words to his brothers. Gen. 50: 20, 21.

5. Moses is Compared to Christ. — Hebrews 3. The points of comparison : He is persecuted as the newborn child ; he is forty years in the wilderness of Midian ; he leads the people of God out of the house of bondage of Egypt through the Red Sea (1 Cor. 10 : 1, 2) ; by him the law was given as the mediator of the old covenant (John 1 : 17, Heb. 3: 2).

0. Joshua. — Points of comparison : His name (Joshua— Jesus, a Savior) ; he leads the people of God into the promised land, to Canaan, and ap[)ortions the same to them.

7. David, as the king chosen by God ; his throne and kingdom ; his people revolt against him and he passes over Cedron to suffer (John 18 : 1) ; but especially a type of Christ in his writings, the Messianic psalms.

8. Jonah, the prophet, whom Christ Himself designated as a type of Himself. Matt. 12 : 40.

b) Material Types.

1. The Offerings, especially the sin-offering and the great offering of atonement. Sacrifices are offerings of man to God for atonement or for gratitude, and symbolize in both cases the payment of a debt ; for they are not intended to be equivalents. Heb. 10 : o.

The sin-offering was made through the slaying and burning of a pure male animal without blemish. The one that sacrificed laid his hands u|)()n the animal, symbolically transferring his sin to it ; then it was bound and slain by the priest to suffer death foi- sin in place of man, and its blood was sprinkled ui)on the altar, the typical emblem of the presence of God. Finally it was burnt, that the odor mio-ht ascend to God. Ex. 29: 18, 25, Lev. 17: 11, Heb. 9: 22.

While through the sin-offerings the sins of the single individual were atoned for, the sacrifice on the great day of atonement was offered by the high priest for the sins of all the people. Lev. 16, 23, Num. 29, John 11 : 50-52, Heb. 9 : 11-28. Christ is both high priest and sacrifice at the same time.

2. The Passover and its Repetition. — Ex. 12, 1 Cor. 5 : 7, John 19 ; o6. Christ connects the institution of the holy supper with the passover and its significance. Matt. 26 : 17, 26-29.

3. The Temple and Priesthood. — Heb. 5-10, John 1 ; 19, 21.

4. The Manna. — Ex. 16; 15; and the rock which gave forth water in the desert. Ex. 17 : 6, 1 Cor. 10: 3, 4, John () : 31-35.

5. The Brazen Serpent. — Num. 21 ; 4-9, John 3 : 14, 15. The serpent, the image of the curse — Christ became a curse for us. Gal. 3 : 13 ; the ser})ent lifted up upon a pole — Christ upon the wood, 1 Peter 2 : 24 ; the believing look upon the serpent brought healing — faith in Christ, the one wlio is lifted upon the cross and

exalted into heaven, brings redemption and deliverance from destruction, flohn >] : 16.

in. The Fulfillment in the New Testament.

1. In Christ all (promises, pro})hecies and ty])es) has been fulfilled, i. e., has come to its perfect realization. That which was indicated by prophecy in word and deed, is realized in Him. This He indicates in the following i)assages : Mark 1 : 15, Luke 22 : 37 ; 24 : 25-27, 44, John 5 : 46 ; 1 : 45, Acts 3 : 18, Rom 1:1, 2, 2 Cor. 1 : 20.

2. In many passages of the New Testament Christ and His apostles appeal exj)ressly to this, that definite promises have been fulfilled in Him, with the remark ; "As it is written," or, " in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled." The following might yet be added as the most important passages :

a) Christ.— Matt. 21 : 16 (Ps. 8 : 2)— Matt. 21 : 42 (Ps. 118: 22)— Matt. 22: 43, 44 (Ps. 110: 1) — Luke 4: 21 (Isa. 61 : 1)— John 13: 18 (Ps. 41: 9) —John 15: 25 (Ps. 69: 4).

b) The Apostles.— Matt. 1 : 22 (Isa. 7 : 14)— Matt. 2 : 15 (Ex. 4 : 22, Hos. 11 : 1)— Matt. 8 : 17 (Isa. 53 : 4, 5)— Matt. 12: 17-21 (Isa. 42: 1-4) Matt. 13 : 35 (Ps. 78 : 2)— Matt. 21 : 4 (Zech. 9 : 9)— Matt. 27 : 35 (Ps. 22: 18)— Mark 15: 28 (Isa. 53: 12)— John 2: 17 (Ps. 69: 9)— John 12: 39-41 (Isa. 6: 9, 10)— John 19: 24 (Ps. 22: 18)— John 19: 28 (Ps. 22: 15)- John 19 : 36 (Ps. 34 : 20)— John 19 : 37 (Zech 12 : 10)— Acts 2: 34-36 (Ps. 110: 1)— Acts 13: 33 (Ps. 2 : 7)— Acts 13 : 47 (Isa. 42 : 6)— 1 Cor. 15 : 54 (Isa. 25: 8, Hos. 13: 14)— Heb. 2: 6-9 (Ps. 8: 4-6) — Heb. 10: 5-10 (Ps. 40: 7-9).

In the old covenant faith was to be awakened and hope enlivened through the promises, prophecies and types in prospect of their fulfillment. The retrospect

of the prophecies and their fulfiUment, the latter of which is not yet fully accomplished (Acts 3: 21), is given a place in the new covenant to strengthen faith and lill the heart with comfort.

(For ordinary instruction it is sufficient to cite the promises under A and B, b and c ; of the prophecies, Isa. 53 ; of the personal types, Isaac and Joseph ; of the material types, the sacrifices and the brazen serpent.)
