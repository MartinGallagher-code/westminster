I. The Suffering of Christ.

1. To the redemptive work of Christ belong His life, suffering and death. This is comprehended in the word suffering. For 1) it was the object of His incarnation to redeem us by His suffering and death, and 2) His whole life was a passion, commencing with His birth and ending with His death.

2. Christ suffered :

a) In bodv. Ps. 22 : 14-16.

b) In souL Matt. 26 : 38.

c) All the time He lived on earth. Isa. 53 : 3.

d) Especially (i. e., in an especially high degree) at the end of His'life. Matt. 27 : 46, 50.

3. This is established in detail in the history of Christ's life and suffering.

A) All The Time He Lived on Earth.

a) In body; 1) The birth in the inn, Luke 2:7; 2) The flight to Egypt (the hardships of the journey) Matt. 2 : 14 ; 3) Hunger, thirst and fatigue. Matt. 4 : 2, John 4 : 6, 7 ; 4) Poverty, Luke 9 : 58.

b) In soul : 1) The temptation by the devil, Matt. 4 : 1 ; 2) The hatred of His enemies, Heb. 12 : 3 ; He was reviled as a glutton and a wine-bibber. Matt. 11 : 19, a blasphemer. Matt. 9 : 3, a child of the devil. Matt. 12 : 24 ; He was rejected at Nazareth, his native city, Luke 4 : 29 ; He was persecuted. Matt. 21 ; 46 : They threatened to stone Him, John 8: 59; 3) The inconstancy of the people, John 6 : 14 ; 7 : 20 ; 4) The weak faith of His disciples. Matt. 8 : 26, Mark 8 : 33 ; 5) Sorrow over the power of death among men, John 11: 33, 35; 6) Anxiety in view of His own death, Luke 12 : 50.

B) At the End of His Life.

a) In body: 1) Drops of bloody sweat, Luke 22: 44; 2) He is bound, John 18: 12; 3) They spit in

His face and buffet Him, Matt. 26: 67; 4) He is scourged and crowned with thorns, Matt. 27 : 26, 29 ; 5) He must bear His own cross, John 19: 17 ; 6) He is nailed to the cross, John 19 : 18 ; 20 : 25, 27 ; 7) He suffers burning thirst, John 19 : 28 ; 8) He dies a painful death, Matt. 27 : 50.

b) In soul : 1) His agony in Gethsemane, Matt. 26 : 37, Luke 22 : 44 ; 2) The betrayal by Judas, Luke 22: 48; 3) Forsaken by all the' disciples, Mark 14: 50 ; 4) Denied by Peter, Luke 22 : 61 ; 5) The false testimony against Him, Matt. 26: 60; 6) The mockery of the soldiers. Matt. 27 : 29 ; 7) The cry of the people, crucify Him ! Mark 15 : 14 ; 8) The railing of the multitude at the cross, Mark 15 : 29, 30; 9) Forsaken by God, ]\latt. 27 : 46.

In catechetical instruction it is not advisable to introduce in detail and to comment upon the entire history of Christ's passion, but the instruction should be limited to the points above introduced, taking it for granted that catechumens are familiar with biblical history.

II. The Cause of Christ's Suffering.

1. Not His own sin or guilt was the cause of Christ's suffering (compare Ques. 10: 1, 2), but "the wrath of God against the sins of all mankind," i. e., the judicial punishment of death and condemnation which God hath decreed against humanity ("the human race" or human nature, in which sin propagates itself) on account of sin. Isa. 53: 4-6. Verse 11 : He shall bear their iniquities {i. e., He atones for sin by enduring the penalty, and, therefore, satisfies, in the place of man, God's violated law). That this prophecy has been fulfilled in Christ, the Apostle Peter attests, 1 Peter 2 : 24 : Who his own self bare our sins in his own body upon the tree (literally, has carried them in His own body upon the wood, i. e., the cross).

152 THE HEIDELBERG CATECHISxM.

2. "The sins of all inankiiul." John 1 : L>1), 1 John 2: 2.

3. That Christ was to bear the sins of the world through His sufferings, rests upon the counsel and \w\\\ of God. Acts 2: 28, 1 Cor. 15: 8, Isu. 58.

III. The Purpose of Christ's Suffering.

1. The purpose of Christ's suffering was our redemption from sin and its punishment, and for the attainment of this end the death of Christ, including llis suffering, was a sacrificial death. " That so by his passion, as the only propitiatory sacrifice, he might redeem our body and soul from everlasting damnation," i. e., set free, redeem, liberate. Isa. 53 : 10, Kom. 5 : 10, 1 Cor. 5 : 7.

2. The sacrificial altar was the cross upon Calvary. The sacrifice of Christ was a burnt-offering. He was offered " upon the tree." The fire which consumed Him was, besides the glowing heat of the sun to which He was exposed during the day, and the burning of His wounds which caused His death, the fire of God's wrath against the sins of all mankind which rested upon Him.

3. Christ's sacrifice was voluntary. John 10 : 18, Matt. 26 : 5'S, Eph. 5 : 2. By His voluntary acceptance of a sacrificial death, Christ's sacrifice far exceeds all the typical sacrifices of the old covenant.

4. The sacrifice of Christ was made for us, i. e., not only for our benefit, but in our stead. It is, therefore, also a vicarious sacrifice. Matt. 20 : 28, 2 Cor. 5 : 14, 1 Tim. 2:6.

5. Christ suffered only in His human nature, in which His divine nature sustained Him. 1 Peter 2 : 24 : In His own body . . . ; Heb. 10 : 10 : Through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

6. The sacrifice of Christ was made but once, and it

avails for all times, and its effects reach unto eternity. Heb. 9 : 12 ; 7 : 25 : Wherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost (literally : perfectly) that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them.*

Christ's sacrifice avails also for believers under the old covenant who lived before Him, since they received the forgiveness of sins, not through the animal sacrifices (Heb. 10: 4), which were only types of the one sacrifice of Christ upon the cross, but through faith in the promised redemption by Christ Jesus. Bom. 3 : 25, 26.

IV. The Benefits of Christ's Suffering.

This benefit is two-fold : 1) That Christ through His suffering redeemed our body and soul from everlasting damnation, and 2) obtained for us the favor of God, righteousness and eternal life.

He has not only averted the incalculable harm that was threatening us, but has also secured for us the greatest benefit.

1. He has redeemed us, body and soul, from everlasting damnation, for He suffered and bore the punishment in His own body and soul for us who are partakers of sin in body and soul. Gal. 3 : 13, Eph. 1 : 7, 1 Cor. 15 : 55, 51.

2. He has secured for and brought to us :

a) The favor of God, i. e., the divine pleasure in those who are cleansed from sin by the blood of Christ. Rom. 5:2.

* Since Christ made a sacrifice on the cross once for all, Christians have no other " altar." Wherefore the Reformed Church, as also the Church of the first centuries, does not recognize an altar in the house of the Lord. It makes use of a table for the celebration of the Lord's Supper, which Christ also instituted and celebrated mth His disciples, not at an altar, but at a table.

b) Righteousness, since we are justified before God by faith on account of Christ's merits. 2 Cor. 5 : 21.

c) Eternal life, which begins not after death, but immediately upon the regeneration of the sinner, as all life has its beginning in birth. John 3 : 14, lo, 1 John 4:9.

The three parts: The favor of God, righteousness and eternal life are expressed in the one passage, Rom. 5 : 21 : That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.
