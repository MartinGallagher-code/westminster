Question  10.  AVill  God  suffer  such  disobedience  and  rebellion  to 
go  unpunished  ? 

Answer.  By  no  means,  but  is  terribly  displeased  with  our  origi- 
nal as  well  as  actual  sins;  and  will  punish  them  in  His  just 
judgment  temporally  and  eternally,  as  he  hath  declared,  *'  Cursed 
is  every  one  that  continueth  not  in  all  things  which  are  written 
in  the  book  of  the  law,  to  do  them." 

Go  Unpiinished  ?  Since  man  cannot  keep  the  law,  will 
not  God  mercifully  overlook  our  helpless  disobedience? 
By  no  means.  His  holiness  makes  Him  hate  sin,  and  His 
justice  makes  Him  punish  it.  IDisploaSGd  (Rom.  1 :  18). 
His  holy  nature  shrinks  from  it  (Heb.  1 :  13).  Terribly. 
Because  His  holiness  is  infinite.  Original.  The  Triglott 
says :  "  inborn  "  sin.  Ques.  7  says,  "  conceived  and  born 
in  sin."  Paul  calls  it  "  the  old  man,'"' the  flesh,"  "the 
carnal  mind  "  (Eph.  4 :  22 ;  Rom.  8  :  7,  8),  i.  e.  the  sinful 
nature  which  we  bring  with  us  into  the  world.  It  is  called 
"  orio;inal."  because  it  comes  from  the  first  sin  of  the  first 
man,  and  also  because  it  is  the  source  of  all  our  wilful 
sins,  and  hence  peculiarly  hateful  to  God.  Actual.  So 
called,  not  because  more  real  than  the  other,  but  because 
they  are  acts  of  the  will.  Punish  them.  He  must  do  so. 
See  Deut.  27  :  26,  freely  quoted  in  Gal.  3 :  10. 

The  punishment  of  sin  is  not  simply  a  matter  of  divine 
justice,  but  necessarily  lies  in  man's  very  nature.  The 
violation  of  law  in  body  or  mind  must  bring  pain.     See 


38  NOIES  ON  THE 

the  cbunkard,  murderer,  thief,  liar,  slanderer.  (Gal.  6 :  7, 8). 

Temporally  and  eternally.    In  this  life,  and  m  the  life'to 

come.  Is  not  this  twice,  and  therefore  unjust?  Xo.  The 
second  is  only  a  continuation  of  the  first,  as  the  life  to 
come  is  only  our  present  life  carried  forward  into  eternity. 
Indeed  temporal  punishment  is  only  a  prophecy,  faint  but 
yet  fearful;  of  what  is  in  store  for  the  foolish  -wicked. 
Some  seem  to  escape  punishment  here  (Job  12:6;  Ps. 
73 :  5-7),  but  the  justice  of  God  reaches  over  into  eternity. 


[    Question  11.    Is  not  God  then  also  mercifal  ? 

Ansicer.  God  is  indeed  merciful,  but  also  just ;  therefore  His 
justice  requires  that  sin,  which  is  committed  against  the  most  high 
majesty  of  God,  be  also  punished  with  extreme,  that  is,  with  ever- 
lasting punishment,  both  of  body  and  soul. 

Merciful.  In  Ques.  9  the  objection  rested  on  His  justice  ; 
here  it  rests  on  His  mercy.  Will  not  His  mercv  shield  us 
from  what  we  deserve  ?  This  is  the  last  hope  of  the  sin- 
ner. Alas  it  fails.  God  IS  also  jUSt.  God  is  not  one- 
sided as  we  are.  Some  men  are  severely  just,  and  lack 
mercy ;  others  are  too  merciful.  But  God  is  infinite  in 
both  justice  and  mercy,  so  that  neither  can  outweigh  or 

push  aside  the  other.    "W"!!!!  everlasting  punishment. 

Why  so  ?  How  can  a  finite  sin  deserve  eternal  punish- 
ment ?  Just  because  committed  against  the  infinite  and 
eternal  God.  Even  among  men  sins  are  regarded  greater 
or  less,  according  to  the  position  of  him  against  whom 
they  are  committed.  It  is  worse  to  strike  a  parent  than  a 
brother  ;  a  teacher  than  a  scholar;  a  king  than  a  peasant. 
Sin  against  the  most  high  majesty  of  God  must  therefore 
be  pimished  with  extreme,  with  everlasting  punish- 
ment (Matt.  25 :  46 ;  Mark  9 :  44-48).      Body  and  SoTll. 


HEIDELBERG  CATECHISM.  39 

Sin  affects  the  whole  man.  Yea,  all  his  powers  join  in  sin- 
ning. He  Qce  in  every  part  he  must  suffer  the  consequences 
of  sin. 

This  ends  Part  First.  Our  misery  then,  is  a  helpless, 
hopeless,  condemnation  under  sin.  And  to  a  sense  of  this 
we  come  by  a  knowledge  of  the  law  (Rom.  3:  20).

HEIDELBERG  CATECHISM.  41 

The  Catechism  does  not  give  a  direct  answer  to  this  ques- 
tion. It  simply  declares  that  the  justice  of  God  must  be 
satisfied,  and  that  "  we,"  the  guilty  party,  must  make  this 
full  satisfaction.  Step  by  step  the  catechumen  was  led  to 
see  his  misery ;  so  step  by  step  is  help  now  revealed.  The 
Catechism  tells  the  story  of  redemption,  only  as  the  way 
is  prepared.  It  presents,  first,  the  difficulties  in  the  way, 
(Ques.  12-14);  then  states  the  qualifications  of  the  Re- 
deemer (Ques.  15-17) ;  and  then  names  Him  (Ques.  18). 


THE  DIFFICULTIES  IN  THE  WAY. 

1)  In  God,  not  in  His  will,  but  in  His  justice.  This 
must  be  satisfied.  He  cannot  loill  a  man  holy,  nor  can  He 
overlook  sin.  This  would  destroy  both  divine  justice  and 
human  accountability.  Satisfaction,  therefore,  must  be 
made,  either  by  ourselves  or  by  another. 

2)  In  man.  Alas,  instead  of  paying  the  debt  we  only 
increase  it.  The  debt  is  original  sin ;  the  increase  is  our 
actual  sins.  No  amount  of  future  obedience  can  pay  the 
debt.  A  bill  is  not  canceled  by  paying  cash  from  to-day, 
but  even  increases  by  interest.  So  in  our  case,  the  old 
debt  becomes  larger,  and  surely  we  cannot  satisfy  the  jus- 
tice of  God. 

3)  In  all  other  creatures.  "  None  "  is  solemnly  emphatic 
in  its  hopelessness.  No  blood  of  beasts  can  avail  (Heb. 
10:  4).  But  might  not  an  angel  satisfy  for  us?  No,  for 
two  reasons :  (1)  God  would  not  punish  him  for  the  sin  of 
man,  any  more  than  a  parent  would  punish  one  child  for 
another.  The  angel  is  holy  enough,  but  has  not  the  right 
nature.  He  is  an  angel,  not  a  man.  (2)  He  lacks  power. 
A  finite  being  cannot  satisfy  infinite  justice.  To  redeem 
man  he  must  not  only  sufiTer  the  penalty  of  sin,  but  also 


42  rise  above  it.  "Sustain  the  burden  "  (Ques.  14)  means,  to 
exhaust  the  due  punishment,  and  rise  above  it.  This  an 
angel  could  not  do. 

So  far,  then,  there  seems  to  be  no  way  of  escape.  Since 
God's  justice  must  be  satisfied,  and  neither  man  nor  any 
mere  creature  is  able  to  do  it,  where  is  there  hope  ?
