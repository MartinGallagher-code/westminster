Question  25.  Since  there  is  but  one  divine  essence,  why  speakest 
thou  of  Father,  Son  and  Holy  Ghost  ? 

Answer.  Because  God  hath  so  revealed  Himself  in  His  word, 
that  these  three  distinct  persons  are  the  only  true  and  eternal  God. 

How  .  .  .  divided?    Into  three  parts.     The  Trinity 

of  course  gives  the  Creed  its  divisions,  because  the  confes- 
sion must  correspond  with  the  objects  of  faith.  Father, 
Son,  and  Holy  Ghost. 

The  Creed  moves  forward  historically,  naming  the  di- 
vine Persons  in  the  order  of  their  revelation.  Hence  in 
any  way  to  change  the  order  is  to  make  confusion.  For 
example  put  the  Holy  Ghost  first,  or  put  the  Son  last,  and 
behold  how  you  have  destroyed  the  force,  meaning  and 
beauty  of  the  Creed,  because  you  have  changed  a  necessary 
order.

HEIDELBERG  CATECHISM.  59 

Yet  there  is  a  unity  of  work  as  well  as  of  essence.  The 
Father  is  called  Eedeemer^Is.  43 :  1).  The  Son  is  called 
Creator  (Col.  1 :  16).  So  is  the  Holy  Ghost  (Gen.  1 :  2). 
Each  has  His  own  office,  and  yet  they  work  together 
(John  5  :  19). 

Unitarians  deny  the  Holy  Trinity,  and  teach  that  in  the 
Godhead  there  is  but  one  Person.  "  How  can  three  be 
one  ?"  they  ask.  Quite  as  easily  as  two  can  be  one  (John 
10 :  30).  This  and  other  heresies  arose  during  the  Eefor- 
mation. 

This  doctrine  is  difficult,  but  not  more  so  than  some 
others ;  and  to  reject  it  on  this  account  would  be  unrea- 
sonable, since  even  nature  around  us  is  full  of  mysteries. 
Indeed  the  whole  Creed  is  for  faith,  and  not  to  be  held  or 
judged  by  niere  reason.  "From  the  alphabet  to  the  Trini- 
ty we  can  proceed  only  by  faith.'' 

There  is  but  one  divine  Essence.    This  we  hold,  over 

against  the  Unitarians,  who  say  there  is  but  one  divine 
Person.  Heathenism  cannot  rise  to  the  idea  of  one  God 
who  governs  the  world,  but  thinks  of  Him  as  limited  and 
weak  like  man.  Rationalism  cannot  rise  to  the  idea  of 
three  Persons  in  the  Godhead.  Therefore  the  Catechism 
asks,  "  Why  speakest  thou  of"  (the  Triglott  adds :  three) 

—Father,  Son  and  Holy  Ghost?    Not  three  Gods,  but 

three  Persons.  We  must  guard  against  tritheism,  which 
does  violence  to  the  divine  unity  of  essence. 

God  hath  so  revealed  Himself.    We  do  not  understand 

it,  but  believe  it.  How  even  man,  with  body,  soul  and  spirit, 
is  yet  one,  we  cannot  understand,  much  less  the  wonderful 
nature  of  God.  God  has  revealed  Himself  as  Father,  Son 
and  Holy  Ghost.  Therefore  we  call  Him  this,  and  believe 
the  mystery. 

References  to  the  Trinity  are  found  even  in  the  Old

See,  too,  how  the  Church  has  set  this  doctrine  in  her 
Creeds.  The  Nicene  and  Athanasian  are  only  a  more  full 
statement  of  the  Apostles'  Creed.  Indeed  almost  every 
word  reminds  us  of  an  old  heresy.  It  is  remarkable,  too, 
that  the  heresies  arose  in  the  order  of  Father,  Son  and 
Holy  Ghost.  This  opens  an  intensely  interesting  chapter 
in  Church  History,  which  you  will  do  well  to  study. 

The  Church  has  set  this  doctrine  also  in  her  Hymns. 
What  are  the  Gloria  Patri,  the  Gloria  in  Excelsis,  and  the 
Te  Deum,  but  ancient  hymns  of  praise  to  the  Trinity  ? 
They  thus  are  a  powerful  preservative  against  error.  So 
are  the  common  but  sacred  doxologies  of  your  hymn  book, 
in  which  this  doctrine  is  so  devotionally  enshrined. 

This  mystery  of  the  Trinity  lies  also  in  the  Church  year. 
The  Church  at  Christmas  celebrates  the  love  of  the  Father ; 
at  Easter,  the  triumph  of  the  Son ;  at  Whitsuntide,  the 
coming  of  the  Holy  Ghost;  and  on  the  next  Lord's  day 
after  Whitsuntide,  namely,  on  Trinity  Sunday,  this  glori- 
ous mystery — the  Holy  Trinity.
