Question  60.  How  art  thou  righteous  before  God  ? 

Anmer.  Only  by  a  true  faith  in  Jesus  Christ ;  so  that,  though 
my  conscience  accuse  me  that  I  have  grossly  transgressed  all  the 
commands  of  God,  and  kept  none  of  them,  and  am  still  inclined  to 
all  evil ;  notwithstanding  God,  without  any  merit  of  mine,  but  only 
of  mere  grace,  grants  and  imputes  to  me  the  perfect  satisfaction, 
righteousness,  and  holiness  of  Christ ;  even  so,  as  if  I  never  had 
had,  nor  committed  any  sin ;  yea,  as  if  I  had  fully  accomplished 
all  that  obedience  which'Christ  hath  accomplished  for  me ;  inas- 
much as  I  embrace  such  benefit  with  a  believing  heart.
