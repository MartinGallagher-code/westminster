ing awav  of  sin  itself? 

Ansirer.  ZS'ot  at  all,  for  the  blood  of  Jesus  Christ  onlv,  and  the 
Holv  Ghost,  cleanse  us  ttom  all  sin. 

The  3r:erz^l  captisn  ^rltli  water.    TKe  Question  does 

not  ask  wkedier  Baptism  is  tlie  vrf.sliz.^  away  of  sin ;  but 
separating  the  two  parts  of  the  Sacrament,  the  visible  and 
the  invisible,  it  asks  about  the  external  baptism.  Is  this 
the  washing  away  of  sin  ?  2Tot  at  alL  Sin  i^  upon  the 
soul,  and  therefore  water  cannot  wash  it  away.  Then,  too, 
water  remains  water,  in  Baptism.  God  does  not  give  the 
visible  element  a  magical  power  to  do  what  does  not  lie  in 

its  nature  (Ques.  78).    For  the  blood and  the 

ZcIt  G'-CSt-  The  cleansing  is  through  these  supernatural, 
invisible  means.  The  external  washing  only  represents 
this  cleansing ;  and  the  efficacy  of  the  Sacrament  lies  in 
the  internal  washing.
