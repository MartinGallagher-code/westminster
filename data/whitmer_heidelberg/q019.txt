Question  19.    "Whence  knowest  thou  this  ? 

Answer.  From  the  Holy  Gospel,  which  God  Himself  revealed 
first  in  Paradise  ;  and  afterwards  published  by  the  Patriarchs  and 
Prophets,  and  was  pleased  to  represent  it  by  the  shadows  of  sacri- 
fices, and  the  other  ceremonies  of  the  law  j  and  lastly  has  accom- 
plished it  by  His  only  begotten  Son. 

Knowest  this,  namely  that  Christ  is  this  Mediator. 
From  the  Holy  Gospel.  Gospel  here  means,  the  good  news 
of  salvation,  the  whole  body  of  God's  revelation  to  man 
from  Eden  to  Pentecost.  The  record  of  this  we  have  in 
the  Old  Testament,  in  promise,  prophecy  and  ceremony, 
and  in  the  New  Testament  in  fulfilment' and  substance. 

The  answer  gives  the  historical  process  of  redemption. 
Christ's  coming  was  through  four  thousand  years.  This 
Gospel,  this  gracious  fact  and  plan  of  redemption,  was  : — 

1)  Revealed.  By  God  Himself  in  Paradise  (Gen.  3  : 
15).  The  world  could  as  little  know  the  Son  as  the  Father 
(1  Cor.  1  :  21).  Man  can  at  all  rightly  know  God  only 
as  He  reveals  Himself 

2)  Published.  By  the  Patriarchs  (Gen.  22 :  17,  18 
28:  14;  49:  10),  and  Prophets  (Is.  11:  10;  7:  14 
Mic.  5  :  2  ;  Is.  53  :  2-12  ;  Ps.  16 :  10  ;  68  :  18  ;  Acts  3 
22,  24). 

3)  Represented.     The  whole  ceremonial  law  was  more 


46.  than  a  mere  order  of  worship, — it  was  a  type  of  things  to 
come.  What  prophets  foretold,  was  set  before  the  very 
eyes  of  Israel  in  sacrifices  and  offerings.  The  daily  lamb, 
the  paschal  lamb,  the  day  of  Atonement,  all  pointed  to 
Christ.  "Other  ceremonies"  likewise  [blameless  priest, 
(Lev.  21 :  17-23)  ;  perfect  sacrifice  (Lev.  22 :  17-25)  ; 
incense,  purifications,  fasts  and  feasts]  did  so. 

4)  Accomplished,  In  Christ  the  eternal  Son  (Heb.  1  : 
1).  He  is  the  fulfilment  of  all  the  types,  shadows,  sacri- 
fices and  ceremonies  that  went  before  Him.
