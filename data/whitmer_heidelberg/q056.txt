Question  56.  "What  believest  thou  concerning  ''  the  forgiveness 
of  sins  ?" 

Answer.  That  God,  for  the  sake  of  Christ's  satisfaction,  will  no 
more  remember  my  sins,  neither  my  corrupt  nature,  against  which 
I  have  to  struggle  all  my  life  long,  but  will  graciously  impute  to 
me  the  righteousness  of  Christ,  that  I  may  never  be  condemned 
before  the  tribunal  of  God. 

The  sense  of  sin,  like  sin  itself,  is  universal.  To  this 
every  heathen  nation,  of  every  age,  bears  witness.  Their 
bloody  sacrifices  speak  of  atonement.     In  Judaism  it  was

deeper  and  more  intelligent,  because  the  people  tad  a 
knowledge  of  God,  tlirough  the  moral  and  ceremonial  law. 
And  now,  in  Christianity,  a  still  deeper  sense  of  sin  is 
possible,  God  having  still  more  fully  revealed  His  holiness. 
How  is  forgiveness  possible  ?     How  can  the  infinitely 

holy  God  forgive  sin  ?  Only  for  the  Sake  of  Christ's  sat- 
isfaction. This  is  the  ground  of  forgiveness  (Ques.  37). 
!N^ot  God's  abstract  mercy,  as  though  He  could  at  once 
declare  the  sinner  free ;  His  equal  justice  forbids  this. 
]^ov  is  it  our  good  works,  as  Eomanism  teaches.  Is  or  is 
it  our  penitence  and  faith,  our  humiliation  and  agonizing 
contrition,  but  Christ  (Eph.  1:7;  Rom.  3 :  24-26) ;  and 
not  merely  His  sufferings  and  death,  but  His  whole  re- 
deeming work,  from  His  incarnation  to  His  ascension, 
as  given  in  Part  Second  of  the  Creed.  On  this  ground 
now,  God  can  deal  graciously  with  the  individual,  and 
this  He  does,   negatively  and  positively  : — 

No  more  remember  my  sins,  neither  my  actual  sins 

nor  my  depraved  nature  which  is  their  source.  He  does 
not  overlook  them,  but  ceases  to  hold  us  for  them,  because 
they  are  fully  cancelled  in  Christ.  This  leads  to  the  posi- 
tive fact. 

The  righteousness  of  Christ.  Our  personal  forgive- 
ness depends  on  our  being  partakers  of  Christ  and  all  His 
benefits.  This  is  possible  only  by  standing  in  right  rela- 
tion to  Christ,  namely,  in  His  Church,  under  the  regene- 
rating and  sanctifying  power  of  the  Holy  Ghost. 

When  the  Catechism  says,  "?nz/  sins"  and  "to  me,"  it 
speaks  of  one  who  is  in  the  covenant,  a  baptized  child, 
standing  in  the  "  communion  of  saints,"  a  member  of  the 
Church,  and  thus  a  partaker  of  Christ. 

G-raoioUSly  impute  to  me.     This  righteousness  God  im- 


HEIDELBERG  CATECHISM.  127 

putes  to  us,  or  rather  imparts*  to  us  (as  the  original  word, 
schenlcet,  means)  as  a  free  and  real  gift.  God  does  not 
merely  call  us  holy,  but  first  makes  us  holy.  He  does  not 
cover  our  sins  with  a  white  robe,  and  so  hide  them  from 
His  eyes;  but  by  the  blood  and  Spirit  of  Christ  He 
cleanses  us  from  sin,  and  imparts  to  us  true  holiness.  The 
Catechism  has  no  sympathy  with  what  is  called  the  impu- 
tation theory,  namely  that  the  righteousness  of  Christ  is 
simply  a  fact  in  the  divine  mind,  externally  set  to  our 
credit  in  book-keeping  style.  The  ground  of  our  personal 
foro-iveness  is  the  rio-liteousness  of  Christ  in  us.  Thus  for- 
giveness  and  deliverance  go  together. 

The  end  of  this  forgiveness  is,  that  I  may  never  bs 
condemned.  Christ  having  fully  satisfied  for  all  my  sins 
(Ques.  1,  37),  God  will  not  now  condemn  me.  Thus  my 
forgiveness  is  sure  because  I  am  in  Him.  If  it  depended 
on  my  works,  I  could  never  be  sure  of  their  sufficiency; 
but  His  satisfaction  was  infinite. 

Of  course  the  conditions  of  forgiveness  are  repentance 
and  faith,  which  include  the  confession  and  forsaking  of 
sins  (Prov.  28 :  13  ;  1  John  1  :  9). 

Struggle  all  mj  life  long.  But  complete  forgiveness  is 
not  complete  deliverance  from  sin.  There  yet  remains  our 
"  corrupt  nature,"  the  old  man,  the  flesh,  against  which 
we,  "  the  new  man,"  the  grace  of  Christ  in  us,  will 
struo-o-le  all  our  life  lono*.  The  death  of  this  old  nature  in 
us,  though  sure,  is  hard  and  slow,  even  a  crucifixion  (Gal. 
5  :  24).  This  old  nature  still  troubles  us,  and  daily  do 
we  sin  because  of  it ;  and  hence  daily  dp  we  need  for- 
giveness. 

Where  is  forgiveness  ?     This  article   of  the  Creed  can 

*  In  Ques.  60,  imputes  is  used,  but  not  alone ;  "  grants  and  im- 
putes."

should  stand  before  that  of  the  Church,  namely,  forgive- 
ness as  a  fitness  for  membership  ;  but  Peter  (Acts  2  :  38) 
told  the  Jews  to  come  into  the  Church  for  forgiveness,  and 
so  Ananias  told  Paul  (Acts  22  :  16). 

The  forgiveness  of  sins  is  in  the  Christian  Church.* 
This  is  God's  ordinary  way  of  delivering  us  from  the  guilt 
and  power  of  sin, — whatever  to  the  contrary  may  be  said 
in  regard  to  possible  and  exceptional  cases. 

How,  now,  does  God  assure  us  of  forgiveness  ?  How 
do  we  certainly  know  that  His  gracious  promises  are  ful- 
filled ?  The  Saviour  cannot  now  lay  His  hand  on  our 
head,  and  by  an  audible  voice  say,  "  Thy  sins  be  forgiven 
thee  "  (Matt.  9:5);  and  yet  we  need  such  visible,  audi- 
ble assurance.  God  be  praised.  He  has  given  it,  namely 
in  the  holy  Sacraments.  These  are  His  acts  to  us,  not 
only  signs,  but  seals  (assurances)  of  His  grace. 

First  of  all.  Holy  Baptism  (Acts  2:  38),  wherein  our 
hearts  are  sprinkled  from  an  evil  conscience  (Heb.  10: 
22),  and  which,  thus,  like  the  act  of  Moses  (Heb.  9 :  19, 
20),  is  God's  declaration  of  our  forgiveness. 

But  as  we  daily  sin,  the  merciful  Sa^dour  does  not  make 
us  go  through  our  whole  life  with  only  this  one,  single, 
sealing  act.  He  repeats  the  assurance  in  a  different  form, 
namely,  in  the  Lord's  Supper.  Question  80  says  :  "  The 
Lord's  Supper  testifies  to  us  that  we  have  a  full  pardon  of 
all  sin." 

Here  again  we  come  into  conflict  with  the  unscriptural 
notion  that  forgiveness  of  sins  is  entirely  independent  of 
the  Church  and  her  ordinances,  a  matter  directly  and 
immediately  between  God  and  the  penitent  believer.  It 
is  astonishing  how  men  irreverently  eviscerate  the  divine 

*  Says  Calvin  :  "  Out  of  her  bosom  there  can  be  no  hope  of  the 
remission  of  sins." 
130  appointments !  Even  in  the  common  relations  of  earthly 
life,  men  want  official  assurance,  authoritative  declarations 
from  those  set  over  them  to  this  end  ;  and  yet  more  neces- 
sary is  this  in  our  relation  to  the  unseen  spiritual,  super- 
natural world  of  grace.  Just  because  Christ  is  in  heaven, 
has  He  set  His  ministers  on  earth  to  speak  and  act  in  His 
name,  and  to  give  men  visible,  audible  assurances  of  His 
really  present  grace  (Luke  10  :  16). 

Therefore  a  faithful  Christian  should  never  doubt  His 
forgiveness.  When  we  come  with  sincere  penitence,  we 
should  believe  ourselves  forgiven,  because  Christ  has 
promised  it.  We  have  no  right  to  go  away  doubting  and 
sad,  as  though  He  had  broken  His  promise. 

"  But,' '  says  one,  "  I  should  feel  that  my  sins  are  for- 
given." True,  but  on  what  do  you  base  this  feeling  ? — 
on  your  act,  or  God's  ? — on  your  penitence,  faith  and  reso- 
lutions, which  are  fitful,  varying  and  doubtful,  or  on  the 
sacramental  declarations  of  Christ,  which  are  abiding  and 
sure  ?  To  make  so  little  account  of  what  He  has  done  is 
very  wrong.  Can  you  not  trust  His  act,  to  say  the  least, 
as  much  as  your  own  ?  So,  the  sick  and  dying  often  want 
to  receive  the  Holy  Communion,  not  because  it  is  necessary 
to  their  salvation,  but  as  the  comforting,  strengthening  as- 
surance of  Christ. 

Just  for  this  reason,  too,  those  outside  of  the  Church, 
refusing  to  enter  the  Covenant  of  Grace,  have  no  assur- 
ance of  pardon.  Forgiveness  is  bound  up  in  deliverance, 
and  indeed  is  made  to  depend  upon  it.  Correctly,  there- 
fore, as  well  as  devoutly,  do  we  pray : 

"  Let  the  water  and  the  blood 
From  Thy  wounded  side  which  flowed, 
Be  of  sin  the  double  cure, 
Cleanse  me  from  its  guUt  and  power"
