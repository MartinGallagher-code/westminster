Question  70.  "What  is  it  to  be  washed  with  the  blood  and 
Spirit  of  Christ  ? 

*AVith  icater  only  (John  3:5;  Acts  10:  47).  This  Christ  ap- 
pointed ;  but  men  have  made  ceremonial  and  even  superstitious  ad- 
ditions, which  cannot  be  approved ;  such  as  breathing  on  the  child, 
putting  salt  into  his  mouth,  exorcising  him,  touching  the  ears  and 
nostrils  with  spittle,  and  putting  holv  oil  on  his  breast,  a  Kghted 
candle  in  his  hand,  and  white  linen  on  his  head. 

t  To  our  one  baptism  we  may  ever  look  back  with  assurance  of 
forgiveness,  if  it  is  the  look  of  penitence  and  faith  (Heb.  10:  22). 


HEIDELBERG  CATECHISM.  151 

Answer.  It  is  to  receive  of  God  the  remission  of  sins,  freely,  for 
the  sake  of  Christ's  blood,  which  He  shed  for  us  by  His  sacrifice 
upon  the  cross ;  and  also,  to  be  renewed  by  the  Holy  Ghost,  and 
sanctified  to  be  members  of  Christ,  that  so  we  may  more  and  more 
die  unto  sin,  and  lead  holy  and  unblamable  lives. 

Ques.  69  speaks  of  Holy  Baptism,  as  a  two-fold  wash- 
ing. Ques.  70  takes  up  the  internal,  invisible  part,  and 
explains  its  meaning.  Receive  of  God,  not  from  the  Church, 
not  from  the  priest.  The  benefits  of  this  washing,  accord- 
ing to  the  definition  in  Ques.  66,  are  two-fold,  negative  and 
positive :  the  remission  of  sins,  and  renewal  by  the  Holy 
Ghost  (Tit.  3  :  5).  These  two  things  cannot  be  separated. 
They  correspond,  the  one  with  "  blood,"  and  the  other  with 
*'  Spirit."  The  one  is  our  justification,  the  other  is  our  sanc- 
tification.  "  Renewing  "  is  further  explained  by  the  words, 
"  sanctified  to  be  members  of  Christ,"  lifted  out  of  our  re- 
lation to  the  first  Adam,  and  livingly  united  to  Christ, 
"  made  holy,"  as  the  word  sanctified  means.  It  is  the 
Sacrament  of  the  new  birth  (John  3:5),  signifying  and 
sealing  our  entrance  into  the  kingdom.  "  By  one  Spirit 
are  we  all  baptized  into  one  body  "  (1  Cor.  12 :  13).  Holy 
Baptism,  thus,  is  the  door  of  the  Church  (Acts  2 :  38,  41). 
In  Baptism  we  become  personally  Christ's.  Hence  the 
expression  "  baptized  into  Christ "  (Rom.  6:3;  Gal.  3  : 
27),  brought  into  such  real  union  with  the  Second 
Adam,  as  we,  by  nature,  have  with  the  first  Adam.  It 
makes  u^  partakers  of  the  life  of  Christ,  as  the  antidote  of 
the  death-power  in  us  through  inherited  sin.  Therefore 
throughout  the  Catechism  the  catechumen  is  taught  that 
he  belongs  to  Christ,  is  a  member  of  the  Church,  a  Chris- 
tian, a  temple  of  the  Holy  Ghost  and  an  heir  of  eternal 
life  (Ques.  1,  54,  32,  53,  59).  Preety.  The  Triglott  says  : 
"  Through  grace,"  not  by  works.     Christ's  blood  is   the

20  and  Mark  16  :  15,  16,  wliicli  plainly  says  that  Baptism 
is  God's  act ;  the  door  of  the  Christian  Church ;  ordina- 
rily necessary  to  salvation  ;  and  not  to  be  separated  from 
repentance  and  faith  (Acts  2  :  38). 

The  quotation  from  Matthew  gives  the  meaning  and 
value  of  Baptism  as  God's  act.  In  the  name  should  be 
translated  into  (as  in  Bom.  6 :  3  and  Gal.  3 ;  27).  It 
means  that  the  individual  is  thereby  lifted  out  of  his  old, 
natural  relation  to  the  first  Adam,  and  brought  into  an 
equally  real  covenant  relation  to  the  Holy  Trinity.  Of  the 
Father  •  •  .  Son  •  •  •  H0I7  Ghost.  So  he  may  now  say, 
*'  My  Father  "  (Ques.  26),  "  I  am  a  member  of  Christ " 
(Ques.  32),  and  "  He  is  also  given  me"  (Ques.  53). 

The  quotation  from  Mark  emphasizes  the  necessary  fit- 
ness in  man  for  this  baptismal  benefit.  He  that  bolieveth. 
Baptism  is  a  real  supernatural  act  of  God,  but  not  a 
magical  power,  even  irresistible.  Its  benefit  avails  only 
for  those  who  by  a  true  faith  lay  hold  of  this  benefit. 
The  act  of  God  and  the  act  of  man  must  come  together 
to  effect  personal  salvation.  This  is  the  only  question  in 
which  anything  is  said  about  man's  fitness  for  baptism ; 
partly,  no  doubt,  because  the  Catechism  is  here  speaking 
of  God's  act  rather  than  man's,  partly,  because  it  had 
often  before  declared  faith  to  be  the  condition  of  receiving 
Christ  and  all  His  benefits  (Ques.  20,  53,  60,  65),  and 
partly,  too,  because  baptism  is  for  children  who  cannot 
bring  any  fitness. 

The  quotations  from  Acts  22 :  16  and  Titus  3  :  5,  cor- 
respond with  the  formula  "  blood  and  Spirit "  of  Christ, 
the  negative  and  the  positive  benefits  of  the  Sacrament. 
Notice,  too,  that  Titus  3 :  5  is  quoted  as  relating  to  Holy 
Baptism.
