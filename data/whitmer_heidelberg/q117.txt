Question  117.  What  are  the  requisites  of  that  prayer,  which  is 
acceptable  to  God,  and  which  He  will  hear  ? 

Ariswer.  First,  that  we  from  the  heart  pray  to  the  one  true  God 
only,  who  hath  manifested  Himself  in  His  word,  for  all  things  He 
hath  commanded  us  to  ask  of  Him  :  secondly,  that  we  rightly  and 


294  thoroughly  know  our  need  and  misery,  that  so  we  may  deeply  hum- 
ble ourselves  in  the  presence  of  His  Divine  majesty:  thirdly,  that 
we  be  fully  persuaded  that  He,  notwithstanding  we  are  unworthy 
of  it,  will,  for  the  sake  of  Christ  our  Lord,  certainly  hear  our 
prayer,  as  He  has  promised  us  in  His  word.
