Question  86.  Since  then  we  are  delivered  from  our  misery,  merely 
of  grace  through  Christ,  >vithout  any  merit  of  ours,  why  must  we 
still  do  good  works? 

Answer.  Because  that  Christ,  having  redeemed  and  delivered  us 
by  His  blood,  also  renews  us  by  His  Holy  Spirit,  after  His  own 
image ;  that  so  we  may  testify  by  the  whole  of  our  conduct,  our 
gratitude  to  God  for  His  blessings,  and  that  He  may  be  praised  by 
us ;  also,  that  every  one  may  be  assured  in  himself  of  his  faith,  by 
the  fruits  thereof;  and  that  by  our  godly  conversation  others  may 
be  gained  to  Christ.
