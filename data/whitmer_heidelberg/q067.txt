Question  67.  Are  both  word  and  sacraments  then  ordained  and 
appointed  for  this  end,  that  they  may  direct  our  faith  to  the  sacri- 
fice of  Jesus  Christ,  on  the  cross,  as  the  only  ground  for  oiu*  salva- 
tion ? 

Answer.    Yes,  indeed  ;  for  the  Holy  Ghost  teaches  us  in  the  gos- 


HEIDELBERG  CATECHISM.  147 

pel,  and  assures  us  by  the  sacraments,  that  the  whole  of  our  salva- 
tion depends  upon  that  one  sacrifice  of  Christ,  which  He  offered  for 
us  on  the  cross. 

Our  salvation  depends  upon  that  one  sacrifice.    Here 

again  stress  is  laid  upon  Christ's  atonement,  not  to  ignore 
other  great  acts  on  which  our  salvation  equally  depends,  and 
"which  the  Catechism  has  emphasized,  for  example,  His 
birth  and  resurrection, — but  because  Komanism  denies 
this  "one  sacrifice  of  Christ "  (Ques.  80).  To  this  only- 
ground  of  salvation  both  word  and  Sacraments  •  .  . 

•  •  •  direct  cur  faith.  The  Holy  Ghost  uses  both.  By 
the  one  He  teaches  us  and  awakens  faith ;  by  the  other 
He  symbolizes  our  redemption,  and  confirms  faith.  Hence 
neither  must  be  ignored.  But  Bomanism  largely  sets 
aside  the  preaching  of  the  word,  and  modern  Protestant- 
ism makes  too  little  of  the  Sacraments.  The  grace  of 
both,  however,  is  only  for  faith.
