Question  58.   What  comfort  takest  thou  from  the  article  of  "  life 

everlasting  ?" 

Answer.  That  since  I  now  feel  in  mr  heart  the  beginning  of 
eternal  jov,  after  this  life  I  shall  inherit  perfect  salvation,  which 
"  eve  hath  not  seen,  nor  ear  heard,  neither  hath  it  entered  into  the 
heart  of  man  "  to  conceive  ;  and  that,  to  praise  God  therein  forever. 


1^  Lif3,  AH  life  is  a  mjsterj ;  and  the  new  life  of  Ciirist 
in  the  believer  (1  Jolm  5 :  12)  is  the  highest  mjsterv,  and 
so  only  f:r  Christian  faith.  This  ereilasdng  life  stands 
oyer  agaiost  eyaia^mg  death  (  John  3  :  36 ;  5 :  29). 
Our  natural  life,  under  the  death  ipom&t  of  an,  comes  to 
us  firom  the  first  Adam,  but  this  is  from  the  Second  Adam 
(Bom.  5 :  12;  1  Cor.  15:22,  4o-i9).

life  to  come  are  but  two  stages  c;  ;  -  e  and  &e  same  life.  The 
eyerlasting  life  begins  here.  I:  is  made  oyer  to  us  by  the 
HoIt  Ghost,  in  the  Qiristian  Churdi,  and  throagh  the 
means  of  grace.'*'  ^ow  is  the  time  of  our  spiritual  diild- 
liood.  We  are  babes  in  Christ,  gro^iziy  in  grace,  and 
ripCTiTRg  into  glory.     We  here  are  TrriT.dng  holiness  (2 

Cbr.  7: 1).    f  shall  izlsrl:  per:^:"  i^T-l-.    The  Tri- 

^ott  says  "  complete  bli^."  The  ccaitrast  lies  betireai 
"  beguming"  and  "  perfect."  What  God  lias  b^mi  in  ns 
He  will  also  in  due  time  complete,  not  in  this  life,  how- 
eyer,  but  ool j  at  the  second  adyent  of  €3izi^  (PhiL  1:6; 
1  John  3 : 2).  ij:er  "hi:  '.1:3,  15iis  article,  coioing  riglit

Oiristian  process:"  and  of  course  thK?  proc^  of  grace

power  of  death.  Here  is  ihe  idea  of  the  Church  trium-

the  same  cycle  for  a  thousand  years ;  but  the  Christian  life

runs  through  only  one  cycle,  from  grace  to  glory,  and 
abides  in  that  heavenly  ripeness  forever.  We  shall  not 
have  to  pass  through  another  probation,  with  the  possibil- 
ity of  falling,  but  will  enjoy  this  glory  forever.  Christ 
has  thus  raised  us  far  above  the  state  of  Adam  before  the 
fall.
