Question  94.    What  does  God  enjoin  in  the  first  command? 

Answer.  That  I,  as  sincerely  as  I  desire  the  salvation  of  my  own 
soul,  avoid  and  flee  from  all  idolatry,  sorcery,  soothsaying,  super- 
stition, invocation  of  saints,  or  any  other  creatures,  and  learn  right- 
ly to  know  the  only  true  God,  trust  in  Him  alone,  with  humility 
and  patience  submit  to  Him,  expect  all  good  things  from  Him 
only  ;  love,  fear,  and  glorify  Him  with  my  whole  heart ;  so  that  I 
renounce  and  forsake  all  creatures,  rather  than  commit  even  the 
least  thing  contrary  to  His  will.
