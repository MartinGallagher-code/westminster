Question  34.     Wherefore  callest  Thou  Him  our  Lord  ? 

Ansiver.  Because  He  has  redeemed  us,  both  soul  and  body,  from 
all  our  sins,  not  with  gold  or  silver,  but  with  His  precious  blood, 
and  hath  delivered  us  from  all  the  power  of  the  devil,  and  thus 
hath  made  us  His  own  property. 


80  Lord.  In  the  Old  Testament,  Lord  is  the  name  of  God 
without  distinction  of  person  ;  but  in  the  New  Testament 
it  is  a  title  of  honor  belonging  to  the  Second  Person  (Phil. 
2 :  11),  and  means  master  or  ruler.  Christ  must  now  be 
to  us  what  in  our  natural  state  the  devil  was.  Our  is  em- 
phatic. Of  course  the  Eternal  Son  was  high  in  heavenly 
dignity ;  but  why  do  we  now  take  honor  to  ourselves  by 
calling  Him  "  our  "  Lord  ?  We  call  Him  so  because  He 
has  redeemed  us,  the  whole  man,  from  all  sin,  not  with 
gold,  which  men  have,  but  with  His  infinitely  availing 
blood  (1  Pet.  1:  18,  19),  and  has  delivered  us  from  all  the 
power  of  the  devil.  Having  thus  made  us  His  own,  He 
is  truly  our  Master.  Him,  therefore,  we  serve,  not  as  slaves 
but  as  sons,  not  in  fear  but  from  love,  not  grudgingly,  but 
with  gladness  of  heart  (Ps.  100 :  2). 

This  answer  is  much  like  the  first :  "  soul  and  body," 
"  all  our  sins,"  "  precious  blood,"  "  delivered  us  from  all 
the  power  of  the  devil," — all  of  which  were  there  suflS.- 
ciently  explained.
