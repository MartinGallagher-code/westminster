Question  61.  Why  sayest  thou  that  thou  art  righteous  by  faith 
only? 

Answei'.  Not  that  I  am  acceptable  to  God  on  account  of  the  wor- 
thiness of  my  faith,  but  because  only  the  satisfaction,  righteousness, 
and  holmess  of  Christ  is  my  righteousness  before  God,  and  that  I 
cannot  receive  and  apply  the  same  to  myself  any  other  way  than  by 
faith  only.
