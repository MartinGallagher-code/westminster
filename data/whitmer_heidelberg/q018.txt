Question  18.     Who  then  is  that  Mediator,  who  is  in  one  person 
both  very  God,  and  a  real  righteous  man  ? 

Answer.     Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ ;  "  who  of  God  is  made  unto  us 
wisdom  and  righteousness,  and  sanctification,  and  redemption." 

The  Triglott  says :  '*  Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  who  is  free-

ly  given  unto  us  for  complete  redemption  and  righteous- 


ness." 


Here,  then,  is  hope.  When  the  Catechism,  by  gradual 
steps,  has  set  before  us  the  need  and  the  qualifications  of  a 
Redeemer,  it  tells  us  who  He  is,  "Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ." 
The  news  comes  like  cheering  day-dawn  after  a  sad  night.
