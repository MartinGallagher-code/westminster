Question  120.  Why  hath  Christ  commanded  us  to  address  God 
thus,  "  Our  Father  ?" 

Answer.  That  immediately,  in  the  very  beginning  of  our  prayer, 
He  might  excite  in  us  a  childlike  reverence  for,  and  confidence  in 
God,  which  are  the  foundation  of  our  prayer ;  namely,  that  God  is 
become  our  Father  in  Christ,  and  will  much  less  deny  us  what  we 
ask  of  Him  in  true  faith,  than  our  parents  refuse  us  earthly  things.
