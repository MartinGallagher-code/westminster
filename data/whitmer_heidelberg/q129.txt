Question  129.  What  doth  the  word  "  Amen  "  signify  ? 

Ansvjer.  "Amen"  signifies,  it  shall  truly  and  certainly  be;  for 
my  prayer  is  more  assuredly  heard  of  God  than  I  feel  in  my  heart 
I  desire  these  things  of  Him. 

Amen.  So  all  our  prayers  end,  and  yet  many  know 
not  its  meaning.  Judging  from  the  hurried,  irreverent 
way  in  which  many  congregations  sit  down,  before  the 
"  amen "  is  half  spoken,  one  might  think  it  means :  the 
prayer  is  ended,  hasten  out  of  the  presence  of  God.  But 
amen  is  as  really  a  part  of  the  Lord's  Prayer  as  "  Our 
Father"  is,  yea,  a  part  of  every  prayer,  and  therefore  to 
be  spoken  and  heard  with  reverence. 

Amen  is  a  Hebrew  word  which  comes  down  to  us  un- 
changed through  Greek,  Latin,  German  and  English.  It 
has  the  same  sound  in  all  languages. 

Amen  was  used  in  all  ages  of  the  Hebrew  Church 
(Deut.  27  :  15-26j.  The  Saviour  and  the  Apostles  intro- 
duced it  into  the  Christian  Church.  It  seals  every  book 
of  the  New  Testament  but  three.     John  heard  it  in  the 


316  worship  of  heaven  (Rev.  19  :  4).  It  is  the  name  of  Christ 
(Rev.  3  :  14),  and  thus  a  very  sacred  word,  meaning, 
faithful  and  true  as  He  is. 

Among  men  the  word  means,  agreement,  assent,  endorse- 
ment,— as  in  hearing  God's  word  and  in  vows  (Neh.  5  : 
13),  and  in  prayer  (1  Chron.  16 :  36 ;  1  Cor.  14  :  16). 

At  the  close  of  a  prayer  "amen"  is:  1)  a  word  of 
prayer,  so  be  it.  "  Amen.  The  Lord  do  so  "  (Jer.  28  ; 
6).  2)  A  word  of  faith,  so  it  shall  be,  for  God  has  pro- 
mised it  (2  Cor.  1 :  20).  "  My  prayer  is  more  assuredly 
heard  of  God,  than  I  feel  in  my  heart  I  desire  these  things 
of  Him."  In  other  words,  our  desire  is  less  certain  than 
His  willingness.*  His  love  is  greater  than  our  sense  of 
need  ;  and  our  faith  in  this  fact  is  expressed  in  the  word 
amen.  So  the  Lord's  Prayer  begins  and  ends  with  the 
spirit  of  adoption :  "  Our  Father Amen." 


AFTER   THIS   INIANNER,   THEREFORE,   PRAY   YE. 

This  is  the  Lord's  Prayer,  and  this  is  its  meaning. 
*'  After  this  manner,  therefore,  pray  ye ;  "  in  these  words, 
as  a  model  form ;  in  this  trusting  spirit  of  sonship  ;  with 
such  brevity  and  fulness. 

Pray  it  devoutly,  intelligently,  thoughtfully,  believingly, 
and  above  all  with  life  as  well  as  with  lip.  When  you 
say  Hallowed,  then  glorify  God  in  body  and  in  spirit ; 
Zingdom,  then  so  live  that  it  may  come  in  you  and 
through  you  ;  will,  then  try  to  obey  it  more  perfectly 
from  day  to  day ;  bread,  then  work  faithfully  and  receive 
it  thankfully ;  forgive,  then  walk  in  newness  of  life,  and 

*  And  vet  how  many  Christians  pray  as  though  God  were  un- 
willing to  answer  them ! 


HEIDELBERG  CATECHISM.  317 

be  merciful  to  others ;  deliver,  then  daily  yield  body,  soul 
and  spirit  to  the  sanctifying  power  of  the  Holy  Ghost. 


IS   CHRIST   IN   THE   LOED's   PRAYER? 

"We  must  always  pray  in  the  name  of  Jesus  Christ,  as 
our  only  Advocate  with  the  Father ;  and  yet  He  is  not 
named  in  the  Lord's  prayer.  Why  not  ?  And  how,  then, 
can  we  use  it  ? 

This  prayer  was  given  before  His  victory  over  death  in 
the  resurrection ;  and  therefore  He  could  not  teach  His 
disciples  to  pray  in  His  name  during  the  days  of  His 
humiliation, — just  as  there  were  no  baptisms  in  His  name 
till  after  His  glorification.  Hence  He  is  not  named  in 
the  prayer. 

And  yet  the  fact  of  Christ  as  the  Redeemer  of  the 
world  and  our  only  High  Priest,  truly  and  plainly  runs 
through  the  whole  prayer  : — 

How  can  God  be  our  Father,  except  through  Jesus 
Christ,  "  of  whom  the  whole  family  in  heaven  and  earth 
is  named  "  (Eph.  3  :  15)  ?  See  Ques.  26,  33.  How  can 
men  hallow  the  Name  of  God  or  do  .His  will,  except  they 
be  first  quickened  by  His  grace  (Eph.  2:1)?  What  King- 
dom, but  Christ's  ?  Who  but  He  is  bread  for  our  souls 
(John  6 :  48)  ?  Where  is  forgiveness,  except  in  His 
Church  and  through  His  blood  (Col.  1  :  14)  ?  How  can 
we  be  delivered  from  sin  except  by  His  grace  and  Spirit  ? 
And  Christ  Himself  is  the  Amen. 

Christ  is  in  the  address,  in  each  petition,  and  in  the 
doxology.  Hence,  though  He  is  not  named,  yet  the  Lord's 
Prayer  is  truly  a  Christian  prayer,  and  none  but  a  Chris- 
tian can  pray  it.     Amen  and  amen.
