Question  53.  What  dost  thou  believe  concerning  the  Holy 
Ghost  ? 

Answer.  First,  that  He  is  true  and  co-eternal  God  with  the 
Father  and  the  Son :  secondly,  that  He  is  also  given  me  to  make 
me,  by  a  true  faith,  a  partaker  of  Christ  and  all  His  benefits,  that 
He  may  comfort  me,  and  abide  with  me  forever. 

Here  begins  the  third  part  of  the  Creed,  "  Of  God  the 

*  Sorrow  and  doubt,  make  us  bow  the  head  (Is.  58 :  5 :  Lam. 
2:  10).

Holy  Ghost  and  our  Sanctification."  The  Creed  is  not 
only  an  order  of  faith,  but  also  truly  historical,  giving  the 
great  facts  of  redemption  each  in  its  proper  place :  God 
the  Father  (Ques.  26-28),  God  the  Son  (Ques.  29-52), 
and  now  God  the  Holy  Ghost  (Ques.  53-58), — Creation, 
Redemption  and  Sanctification.  The  idea  of  redemption 
from  sin  runs  through  the  whole  third  part :  by  the  Holy 
Ghost,  in  the  Christian  Church,  through  the  victory  of 
grace  over  sin,  which  becomes  complete  in  the  resurrec- 
tion of  the  body  and  the  life  everlasting. 

The  Holy  Ghost  came  at  Pentecost  (Acts  2 :  1-36), 
fifty  days  after  the  resurrection  of  Christ,  over  eighteen 
hundred  and  forty  years  ago. 

But  was  He  not  in  the  world  before  Pentecost  ?  Yea, 
verily,*  but  not  as  now.  His  manifested  presence  and 
activity  were  only  occasional,  enlightening  and  inspiring 
God's  people  for  certain  ends ;  but  now  He  is  fully  and 
abidingly  present.  As  Christ  was  in  the  world  before  His 
incarnation,  but  very  difierently  after  it,  so  in  regard  to 
the  Holy  Ghost.  Hence  His  coming  on  the  day  of  Pente- 
cost is  the  beginning  of  a  new  era  in  the  history  of  re- 
demption. The  disciples  were  "filled  with  the  Holy 
Ghost ''  (Acts  2:4);  Peter  calls  this  the  fulfillment  of  the 
prophecies  about  His  coming  (Acts  2 :  16-33  ;  comp.  Joel  2 : 
28-31) ;  and  the  language  of  the  New  Testament  about 
the  Holy  Ghost  is  very  different  from  that  of  the  Old.f 
The  one  says  He  shall  be  given,  and  this  was  not  yet  done 

*)  He  was  in  the  Old  Testament  Church,  afiecting  men  in  vari- 
ous ways.  To  Samson  He  gave  strength  ( Judg.  13 :  25) ;  to  Be- 
zaleel  mechanical  skill  (Ex.  31 :  3) ;  to  many  the  gift  of  prophecy 
(Num.24:  2;  1  Sara.  19:  20;  2  Pet.  1:  21). 

t  All  the  references  to  the  Holy  Ghost  in  the  Old  Testament  can 
be  understood  only  in  the  light  of  the  New  Testament. 


112  in  the  time  of  Christ  (John  7 :  39)  ;  the  other  says  that 
men,  as  living  temples,  received  the  Holy  Ghost  (Acts  2 : 
4,  38 ;  8 :  17  ;  1  Cor.  6 :  19).  The  Jews  of  that  day  could 
not  have  confessed  the  Creed.  They  expected  the  Son, 
and  knew  nothing  about  the  Holy  Ghost.  This  only 
shows  that  His  coming  at  Pentecost  was  very  different 
from  any  previous  presence. 

Therefore  it  was  accompanied  with  peculiarly  solemn 
and  impressive  signs,  a  rushing  wind,  fiery  tongues  and 
extraordinary  speech,  both  to  convince  the  disciples  and  to 
arrest  the  attention  of  the  multitude.* 

This  personal  and  full  coming  of  the  Holy  Ghost  was 
the  founding  of  the  Christian  Church,  in  its  earthly, 
visible  and  organized  form ;  and  then  the  Jewish  Church, 
or  Old  Testament  dispensation  ceased  to  exist.  His  coming 
thus  forms  an  epoch  in  the  history  of  redemption,  and 
deserves  the  special  honor  which  it  receives  at  Whitsun- 
tide. 

The  Catechism  presents  the  article  concerning  the  Holy 
Ghost  under  two  heads, — His  person,  and  His  work ;  what 
He  is  in  Himself,  and  what  He  is  for  us. 

1)  His  Person.  He  is  not  a  mere  power,  influence  or 
attribute  of  God,  but  tniS  and  CO-Stemal  G"Od,  a  real 
divine  person,  distinct  from  the  Father  and  the  Son,  and 
co-equal  with  both. 

(1)  He  is  a  real  divine  person.  He  searches  (1  Cor.  2: 
10)  ;  gives  gifts  (1  Cor.  12 :  4-11) ;  intercedes  (Rom.  8 : 

*  Every  great  epoch  opens  with  some  such  visible  evidence  of 
divine  presence  and  power.  At  Sinai,  thunder,  lightning,  smoke, 
sound  of  a  trumpet,  &c.;  at  the  birth  of  Christ,  angelic  messengers 
and  a  guiding  star ;  at  His  death  and  resurrection,  great  darkness, 
rending  veil,  and  quaking  earth.  So  at  His  second  coming  shall 
great  signs  appear  (Matt.  24 :  3,  30). 


HEIDELBERG  CATECHISM.  113 

26);  witnesses  (Rom.  8:  16);  guides  (John  14:  26;  Acts 
13 :  2,  4) ;  is  belied  (Acts  5:3);  grieved  (Eph.  4 :  30)— 
acts  which  can  be  predicated  only  of  a  person.  (2)  Dis- 
tinct from  the  Father  and  the  Son  (Luke  3 :  22 ;  John 
14:  26;  Matt.  28:  19;  2  Cor.  13:  14).  (3)  Co-equal 
with  the  Father  and  the  Son.  See  Matt.  28 :  19  and 
2  Cor.  13 :  14,  in  which  the  three  Persons  of  the  adorable 
Trinity  are  named  together  as  equals.  Of  course  the 
divinity  of  Christ  settles  also  the  co-equality  of  the  Holy 
Ghost,  since  duality  in  the  Godhead  is  impossible. 

All  this  is  beautifully  expressed  in  the  Creeds,  Litanies, 
Te  Deum  and  doxologies  of  the  Church. 

As  the  names  of  Father  and  Son  are  significant,  so  also 
His :  Holy  Ghost  or  Spirit.  These  two  are  the  same  in 
sense  (Luke  23 :  46),  and  mean  an  immaterial  being,  the 
Third  Person  of  the  Trinity ;  and  "  Holy  "  is  added  to  dis- 
tinguish Him  from  all  created  spirits.  He  being  infinitely 
and  unchangeably  holy. 

2)  His  work.  How  great  and  varied  this  is,  and  how 
closely  related  He  stands  to  tLe  work  of  redemption,  may 
be  seen  from  the  fact  that  the  Catechism  refers  to  the 
Holy  Ghost  about  thirty  times:  Ques.  1,  8,  21,  23,  24,  25, 
31,  32,  35,  49,  51,  53,  54,  65,  67,  69,  70, 71,  72,  73,  74,  76, 
79,  80,  86,  103,  109,  115,  116,  123,  127. 

He  is  also  given  me,  says  the  catechumen,  the  baptized 
child  of  the  Church,  standing  thus  really  in  the  covenant 
of  grace. 

We  receive  the  Holy  Ghost  now  just  as  men  received 
Him  in  the  days  of  the  Apostles,  namely,  in  holy  baptism 
(John  3:5;  Acts  2  :  38  ;  19 :  1-7  ;  1  Cor.  12  :  13). 
"  Given  me."  AVhat  a  mystery  for  faith  !  Let  this  be 
reverently  said  but  yet  firmly  held  as  a  sure  and  blessed 
fact  in  our  Christian  life.  Temples  of  the  Holy  Ghost  we 
8         ^ 


114  are  (1  Cor.  3 :  16, 17 ;  Kom.  8 :  11).  To  make  me  a  par- 
taker of  Christ  and  all  His  benefits.  The  Catechism  says 
nothing  about  His  extraordinary  work,  such  as  inspiration 
(2  Pet.  1 :  21)  and  special  gifts  (1  Cor.  12 :  4-11),  nor  of 
what  He  does  upon  the  unregenerate,  but  speaks  only  of 
His  ordinary  work  in  the  Church.  He  regenerates,  enlight- 
ens, quickens,  sanctifies,  and  glorifies  us.  This  work  is  upon 
body  and  soul,  and  reaches  out  even  to  the  resurrection 

from  regeneration  to  glorification.      This  process 

of  grace  is  seen  in  Part  Third  of  the  Creed  :  Church,  com- 
munion, forgiveness,  resurrection,  life  everlasting.  Each 
person  of  the  Trinity  is  said  to  have  His  own  peculiar  office 
and  distinct  work, — creation,  redemption  and  sanctifica- 
tion.  Sanctify  means  "  to  make  holy."  This  is  the  office 
of  the  Holy  Ghost,  who  changes  and  fashions  us  like  unto 
the  glorious  likeness  of  Christ.  All  this  He  does,  of 
course,  in  the  Church  and  through  the  means  of  grace 
which  Christ  appointed.  By  a  true  faith.  This  is  our 
part.  Our  baptismal  birthright  brings  Christ  and  all  His 
benefits  within  our  reach ;  but  we  must  now  by  our  own 
personal  act  of  faith  lay  hold  of  all  this  grace  at  hand.  He 
can  do  nothing  if  we  resist  Him.  Grace  is  not  irresistible. 
Hence  the  solemn  warning,  "  Grieve  not  the  Holy  Spirit  of 
God "  (Eph.  4 :  30).  Comfort  me.  By  delivering  me 
from  the  misery  of  sin  through  His  gracious  inworking 
and  making  me  a  partaker  in  full  of  Christ's  victorious 
grace.  Abide  with  me  forever.  He  is  not  here  for  a  season, 
as  Christ  was,  but  will  remain  until  the  second  coming  of 
Christ  (John  14 :  16).  Nor  is  He  with  the  Church  irregu- 
larly, by  spells,  here  to-day  and  gone  to-morrow,  so  that  we 
must  pray  for  His  return,  and  thus  never  be  sure  of  His  pre- 
sence. He  abides  with  us.  And  this  is  as  true  of  the  indi- 
vidual Christian  as  it  is  of  the  Church.  "  Abide  with  me."
