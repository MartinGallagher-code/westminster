Question  101.  May  we  then  swear  religiously  by  the  name  of 
God? 

Answer,  Yes ;  either  when  the  magistrates  demand  it  of  the  sub- 
jects, or  when  necessity  requires  us  thereby  to  confirm  fidelity  and 
truth,  to  the  glory  of  God,  and  the  safety  of  our  neighbor  ;  for  such 
an  oath  is  founded  on  God's  word,  and  therefore  was  justly  used  by 
the  saints,  both  in  the  Old  and  New  Testament.
