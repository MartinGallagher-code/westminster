Question  112.     What  is  required  in  the  ninth  command  ? 

Answer.  That  I  bear  false  witness  against  no  man,  nor  falsify 
any  man's  words ;  that  I  be  no  backbiter,  or  slanderer ;  that  I  do 
not  judge  or  join  in  condemning  any  man  rashly  or  unheard;  but 
that  I  avoid  all  sorts  i)f  lies  and  deceit,  as  the  proper  works  of  the 
devil,  unless  I  would  bring  down  upon  me  the  heavy  wrath  of 
God ;  likewise,  that  in  judgment  and  all  other  dealings  I  love  the 
truth,  speak  it  uprightly,  and  confess  it ;  also,  that  I  defend  and 
promote  as  much  as  I  am  able  the  honor  and  good  character  of  my 
neighbor. 


I.  WHAT   THE   COIVIMANDMENT   FORBIDS. 

That  I  bear  ...  or  unheard  is  the  negative  part  of 

the  answer.  This  Commandment  has  to  do  with  sins  of 
the  tongue,*  especially  with  lying,  in  all  its  forms,  a  sin 
most  hurtful  to  man,  and  most  hateful  to  God.  Neighbor 
is  not  a   new  word.     It  lies  in  the  sixth,  seventh  and 

*  How  significant,  that  two  Commandments  relate  to  the  tongue, 
the  third  and  the  ninth !

stands  in  ils  relation  to  man,  as  a  wxKHig  to  our  nei^Lbor 
^x.  23:  1). 

i    False  witness  in  private  is  called  lying,  saying  what 
is  1. : :  irue  Irar  tiie  pmpoee  of  deceiving. 

How  jR&a.  lie  in  busing  (Prov.  20 :  14)  I — oiiben  for 
five  cents !  Five  ndli ;  i_s  would  not  make  it  rights  but  the 
si^iLir  :dr  5  1L1.  zne  more  ecMifcemptible  tbe  act.  Men 
ofijen  lie  in  their  advertiseniQits,  labds  and  agns. 

So  in  political  campaigrgL  Who  pr^ends  to  believe 
idiat  speakscs  and  papas  say  of  candidates  ? 

In  convexEatifHi  also  lying  is  t€xj  comnion.  Many  lie 
amply  fiom  babit^  and  without  any  motive.  Some  nice 
people  are  ^ezj  unreliable,  Thar  word  cannot  be  taken 
at  par.  M@i  talk  of-  **  whiie "  B^ ;  but  the  Scriptures 
know  nothing  of  them.  Indeed  they  ^e  not  innocent. 
LxHiy  is  not  lying,  &r  all  know  that  Ibe  speaker  does  not 
mean  what  he  says  (1  Kg.  18 :  27).  Xor  is  it  lyingwhen 
we  withhold  part  of  the  truth,  whicb  we  often  mnst  do 
(Prov.  29:  11;  10:  19);  but  in  this  case  we  must  not 
pro&ss  to  be  giving  the  whole  truth.  To  lie  tiutw^  an- 
other is  just  as  wrmg  as  to  do  it  with  our  own  lips  (Matt. 
28  :  13). 

Men  may  lie  also  by  acts  (Prov.  6 :  12-14)  ;  as  did  the 


HEIDELBERG  CATECHISM.  •  283 

Gibeonites  (Josh.  9  :  3-6)  ;  and  Absalom  (2  Sam.  15  :  5), 
like  office-seekers  of  our  own  day  ;  and  Ananias  (Acts  5  : 
2)  ;  and  all  who  make  a  false  show  of  wealth,  politeness 
or  piety. 

Boasting  and  flattery  are  forms  of  lying.  Boasting  is 
overdue  *  self-praise.  Flattery  is  the  false  praise  of  an- 
other, and  there  is  much  of  it  among  men.  Favors  are 
bought  with  it  (Matt.  22  :  16),  and  friends  are  kept  by  it. 
Flattery  spreads  a  net  and  works  ruin  (Prov.  29  :  5 ;  26  : 
28).  ''  Therefore  meddle  not  with  him  that  flattereth  " 
(Prov.  20 :  19  ;  Ps.  12  :  2).  How  empty  and  even  false 
many  compliments,  apologies  and  excuses  in  social  life 
are  !  Even  the  dead  are  flattered  to  cajole  the  living. 

Lying  is  very  hateful  to  God  (Prov.  6:17;  12 :  22). 
Almost  the  last  word  that  He  says  to  man  is  that  no  liar 
can  enter  heaven  (Rev.  22  :  15). 

2)  ITor  falsify  any  man's  words.    The  Triglott  says 

**  wrest,"  i.  e.  to  use  his  words,  but  not  as  he  used  them,  f 
to  use  them  only  in  part,  or  out  of  their  proper  connection, 
or  in  any  other  way  to  change  their  sense.  This  is  only 
too  common  in  debates  and  controversi^,  verbal  and  writ- 
ten, religious  and  political. 

3)  Backbiter,  one  who  speaks  evil  of  those  absent.     The 

most  common  form  is  slander. 

4)  Slanderer,  one  who  circulates  false  reports  for  the 
purpose  of  injuring  another.  The  New  Testament  Greek 
word  is  diabolos,  "  accuser,"  and  is  the  common  name  of 

*  Even  in  the  truth  we  should  take  Solomon's  advice  (Prov. 
27  :  2). 

t  Closely  connected  with  this  is  the  betrayal  of  confidence,  tell- 
ing another  what  was  sacredly  entrusted  to  your  keeping.  This  is 
as  cruel  as  it  is  wrong.  Friends  may  quarrel  and  separate,  but  se- 
crets must  be  held  sacred.

devil  and  of  the  wicked  (John  8  :  44).  How,  then,  can 
a  Christian  have  part  in  them  ?  Besides  this,  they  bring 
upon  men  the  wrath  of  God,  and  we  must  shun  them 
(Prov.  12  :  22  ;  Pwev.  21 :  8). 

2)  Love  the  truth,  speak and  confess  it. 

This  is  more  positive,  and  the  expression  of  the  life  and 
Spirit  of  Christ  in  us  (Eph.  4  :  24,  25;.  This  we  must 
always  do,  whether  profitable  and  easy  or  otherwise.  The 
flesh  may  rebel,  and  the  world  may  laugh  at  us,  but  we 
must  always  uphold  truth.  "We  may  even  feel  bound  to 
take  back  our  own  words,  and  confess  a  wrong.  Indeed 
a  man  should  have  moral  courage  to  do  it  at  once.  We 
must  both  speak  and  act  the  truth. 

3;  Defend  and  promote  •  .  -the  honor .  •  .  of  my 

neighbor.  This  good  Jonathan  did  (1  Sam.  19:  4),  and 
even  poor  time-serving  Pilate  (Luke  23 :  14,  22).  This 
the  Christian  law  of  love  demands.  We  must  not  be 
silent,  when  men  falsely  speak  IQ  of  our  brother.  Often 
we  should  rebuke  the  backbiter.
