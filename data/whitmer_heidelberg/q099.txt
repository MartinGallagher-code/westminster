Question  99.  What  is  required  in  the  third  command  ? 

Ansiver.  That  we,  not  only  by  cursing,  or  perjury,  but  also  by 
rash  swearing,  must  not  profane  or  abuse  the  name  of  God  ;  nor  by 
silence  or  connivance  be  partakers  of  these  horrible  sins  in  others  ; 
and  briefly,  that  we  use  the  holy  name  of  God  no  otherwise  than 
with  fear  and  reverence  ;  so  that  He  may  be  rightly  confessed  and 
worshiped  by  us,  and  be  glorified  in  all  our  words  and  works.
