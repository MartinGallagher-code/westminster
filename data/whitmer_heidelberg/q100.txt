Question  100.  Is  then  the  profaning  of  God's  name,  by  swearing 
and  cursing,  so  heinous  a  sin,  that  His  wrath  is  kindled  against 
those  who  do  not  endeavor,  as  much  as  in  them  lies,  to  prevent  and 
forbid  such  cursing  and  swearing  ? 

Answer.  It  undoubtedly  is ;  for  there  is  no  sin  greater,  or  more 
provoking  to  God,  than  the  profaning  of  His  name,  and  therefore 
He  has  commanded  this  sin  to  be  punished  with  death.
