Question  62.  But  why  cannot  our  good  works  be  the  whole  or 
part  of  our  righteousness  before  God  ? 

Ansicer.  Because  that  the  righteousness  which  can  be  approved 
of  before  the  tribunal  of  God,  must  be  absolutely  perfect,  and  in  all 
respects  conformable  to  the  divine  law ;  and,  also,  that  our  best 
works  in  this  life  are  all  imperfect  and  defiled  with  sin.
