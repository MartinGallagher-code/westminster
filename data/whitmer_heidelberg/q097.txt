Question  97.    Are  images  then  not  at  all  to  be  made  ? 

Answer.  God  neither  can  nor  may  be  represented  by  any  means ; 
but  as  to  creatures,  though  they  may  be  represented,  yet  God  forbids 
us  to  make,  or  have  any  resemblance  of  them,  either  in  order  to 
worship  them,  or  to  serve  God  by  them.
