Question  47.  Is  not  Christ  then  with  us,  even  to  the  end  of  the 
world,  as  He  promised  ? 

Ans^cer.  Christ  is  very  man  and  verv  God :  with  respect  to  His 
human  nature,  He  is  no  more  on  earth ;  but  with  respect  to 
His  Godhead,  majesty,  grace  and  Spirit,  He  is  at  no  time  absent 
from  us.
