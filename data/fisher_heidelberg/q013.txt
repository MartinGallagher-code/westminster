DOCTRINES   SEPARATED  AND  PROVED. 

1.  We  cannot,  of  ourselves,  make  satisfaction  to  the  justice  of 
God  for  our  sins.  Job  ix.  2,  3 — But  how  should  man  be 
just  with  God?  If  he  will  contend  with  him,  he  cannot 
answer  him  one  of  a  thousand.    See  also  chap.  xv.  14-16. 

2.  We  daily  commit  sin.  Gen.  vi.  5 — Every  imagination 
of  the  thoughts  of  his  [man's]  heart  was  only  evil  con- 
tinually. Ps.  xix.  12 — Who  can  understand  his  errors  ? 
Rom.  vii.  19. 

3.  By  our  daily  transgressions  ice  arc  continually  increasing 
our  debt,  or  the  punishment  we  owe  to  the  justice  of  God  on 
account  of  our  sins.  Matt.  vi.  12 — And  forgive  us  our  debts 
as  we  forgive  our  debtors.  Bom.  ii.  5 — But  after  thy  hard- 
ness and  impenitent  heart,  treasurest  up  unto  thyself  wrath 
against  the  day  of  wrath,  and  revelation  of  the  righteous 
judgment  of  God.    Isa.  lxiv.  6.

affirmed  in  the  answer?  What  do  you  mean  by  debt?  (b.) 
How  do  you  prove  that  we  daily  commit  sin  ?  (2.)  How  do
