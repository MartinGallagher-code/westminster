Q.  7.  Whence  then  proceeds  this  depravity  of  human 
nature  ? 

A.  From  the  fall  and  disobedience  of  our  first  parents, 
Adam  and  Eve,  in  Paradise ;  hence  our  nature  is  become 
so  corrupt,  that  we  are  all  conceived  and  born  in  sin. 

EXPLANATIONS. 

a.  Depravity,  corruption. 

b.  Human  nature,  the  moral  constitution  of  man. 

c.  Fall,  transgression  of  Adam. 

d.  Disobedience,  violation  of  a  lawful  command. 

e.  First  parents,  the  common  parents  of  mankind. 

/.  Paradise,  the  blissful  garden  of  Eden,  in  which  Adam 
and  Eve  were  placed  after  they  were  created. 

g.  In  sin,  in  a  condition  in  which  we  are  polluted  with  sin, 
and  strongly  inclined  to  its  commission. 

DOCTRINES   SEPARATED  AND  PROVED. 

1.  Mankind  are  in  a  corrupt,  depraved  state.  Ps.  liii.  1 — 
Corrupt  are  they,  and  have  done  abominable  iniquity:  there 
is  none  that  doeth  good.    Ps.  xiv.  1-3.    Rom.  iii.  9-12. 

2.  All  mankind  are  the  descendants  of  Adam  and  Eve.  Gen. 
iii.  20 — And  Adam  called  his  wife's  name  Eve  ;  because  she 
was  the  mother  of  all  living.  Acts  xvii.  26 — And  hath 
made  of  one  blood  all  nations  of  men,  for  to  dwell  on  all 
the  face  of  the  earth. 

3.  Mankind  were  brought  into  the  corrupt  state  in  which  they 
now  are  by  the  fall  of  Adam.  Rom.  v.  12 — By  one  man  sin 
entered  into  the  world,  and  death  by  sin:  and  so  death 
passed  upon  all  men,  for  that  all  have  sinned.  1  Cor.  xv. 
22 — In  Adam  all  die. 

4.  In  consequence  of  this  corrupt  state,  mankind  are  all  con- 
ceived in  sin.  Ps.  li.  5 — Behold  1  was  shapen  in  iniquity, 
and  in  sin  did  my  mother  conceive  me. 

5.  In  consequence  of  this  corrupt  state,  mankind  are  all  bom 
in  sin.  John  iii.  6 — That  which  is  born  of  flesh  is  flesh. 
Job  xiv.  4 — Who  can  bring  a  clean  thing  out  of  an  unclean  ? 
not  one. 

EXERCISES. 

What  is  the  subject  of  inquiry  in  this  question  ?  What  is 
meant  by  depravity?  (a.)  What  by  human  nature?  (b.) 
How  do  you  prove  that  mankind  are  in  a  corrupt  state  ?  (1.) 


20  What  does  the  question  ask  with  respect  to  the  depravity 
of  human  nature  ?  Whence  does  the  answer  say  this  de- 
pravity proceeds  ?  What  do  you  mean  by  the  fall?  (c.) 
What  by  disobedience?  (d.)  What  are  the  names  of  our  first 
parents  ?  What  do  you  mean  when  you  call  Adam  and  Eve 
our  first  parents?  (<?.)  Row  do  you  prove  that  all  man- 
kind are  the  descendants  of  Adam  and  Eve  ?  (2.)  Where 
did  this  fall  of  Adam  take  place  ?  What  is  meant  by 
Paradise?  (/.)  How  do  you  prove  that  mankind  were 
brought  into  their  present  corrupt  state  by  the  fall  of 
Adam  ?  (3.)  What  influence  does  the  answer  say  this  fall 
had  upon  our  nature?  What  do  you  mean  by  the  phrase 
in  sin?  (g.)  How  do  you  prove  that  mankind,  in  conse- 
quence of  this  corrupt  state,  are  all  conceived  in  sin?  (4.) 
How  do  you  prove  that  mankind,  in  consequence  of  this 
corrupt  state,  are  all  born  in  sin?  (5.)
