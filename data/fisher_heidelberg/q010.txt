Q.  10.  Will  God  suffer  such  disobedience  and  rebel- 
lion to  go  unpunished  ? 

A.  By  no  means :  but  is  terribly  displeased  with  our 
original  as  well  as  actual  sins  ;  and  will  punish  them  in 
his  just  judgment,  temporally  and  eternally,  as  he  hath 
declared,  "  Cursed  is  every  one  that  continueth  not  in  all 
things  which  are  written  in  the  book  of  the  law,  to  do 
them."

own  person.

DOCTRINES  SEPARATED  AND  PROVED. 

1.  God  is  terribly  displeased  with  our  original  sin.  Eph.  ii. 
3 — And  were  by  nature  the  children  of  wrath,  even  as 
others.  Rom.  v.  12 — By  one  man  sin  entered  into  the  world, 
and  death  by  sin ;  and  so  death  passed  upon  all  men,  for 
that  all  have  sinned. 

2.  God  is  ter  ribly  displeased  with  our  actual  sins.  Ps.  v.  5 — 
Thou  hatest  all  workers  of  iniquity.  Ps.  vii.  11 — God  is 
angry  with  the  wicked  every  day. 
[Q.ll. 


3.  God  will  punish  our  sins.  Prov.  xi.  21 — Though  hand 
join  in  hand,  the  wicked  shall  not  be  unpunished.  Eom. 
i.  18 — For  the  wrath  of  God  is  revealed  from  heaven  against 
all  ungodliness  and  unrighteousness  of  men.    Prov.  xvi.  5. 

4.  God  punishes  sin  temporally,  that  is,  in  the  present  life. 
Ps.  lv.  28 — Bloody  and  deceitful  men  shall  not  live  out  half 
their  days.  Gen.  xix.  24 — Then  the  Lord  rained  upon 
Sodom  and  upon  Gomorrah,  brimstone  and  fire  from  the 
Lord  out  of  heaven. 

5.  God  will  punish  sin  in  the  life  to  come.  Heb.  ix.  27 — 
And  it  is  appointed  unto  men  once  to  die,  but  after  this  the 
judgment.  Luke  xvi.  23 — And  in  hell  he  lifted  up  his  eyes, 
being  in  torments. 

6.  The  judgment  by  which  God  punishes  sin  is  a  just  judg- 
ment. Rom.  ii.  2 — We  are  sure  that  the  judgment  of  God 
is  according  to  truth.  Ps.  xix.  9 — The  judgments  of  the 
Lord  are  true  and  righteous  altogether.
