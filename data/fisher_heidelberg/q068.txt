DOCTRINES   SEPARATED  AND  PROVED. 

1.  Christ  instituted  the  sacrament  of  baptism.  Matt,  xxviii. 
19 — Go  ye  therefore,  and  teach  all  nations,  baptizing  them 
in  the  name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy 
Ghost. 

2.  Christ  instituted  the  sacrament  of  the  Lord's  supper.  1 
Cor.  xi.  23-25 — The  Lord  Jesus,  the  same  night  in  which  he 
was  betrayed,  took  bread ;  and  when  he  had  given  thanks, 
he  brake  it,  and  said,  Take,  eat :  this  is  my  body,  which  is 
broken  for  you :  this  do  in  remembrance  of  me.  After  the 
same  manner  also  he  took  the  cup,  when  he  had  supped, 
saying,  This  cup  is  the  new  testament  in  my  blood :  this 
do  ye,  as  oft  as  ye  drink  it,  in  remembrance  of  me.
