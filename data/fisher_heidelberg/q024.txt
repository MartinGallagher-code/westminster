2.  God  the  Son  is  our  Redeemer.  Gal.  iii.  13 — Christ  hath 
redeemed  us  from  the  curse  of  the  law,  being  made  a  curse 
for  us.  1  Pet.  i.  18,  19 — Ye  were  not  redeemed  with  cor- 
ruptible things,  as  silver  and  gold ;  but  with  the  pre- 

cious  blood  of  Christ.    Rom.  iii.  24,  25.

tiles, ministering  the  gospel  of  God,  that  the  offering  up  of 
the  Gentiles  might  be  acceptable,  being  sanctified  by  the 
Holy  Ghost.  1  Cor.  vi.  11 — And  such  were  some  of  you: 
but  ye  are  washed,  but  ye  are  sanctified,  but  ye  are  justi- 
fied in  the  name  of  the  Lord  Jesus,  and  by  the  Spirit  of 
our  God.    1  Pet.  i.  21,  22.

God.  1  John  v.  7 — For  there  are  three  that  bear  record  in 
heaven,  the  Father,  the  Word,  and  the  Holy  Ghost;  and 
these  three  are  one.  John  x.  30 — I  and  my  Father  are  one.
