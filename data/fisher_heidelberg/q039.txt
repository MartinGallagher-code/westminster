Q.  39.  Is  there  any  tiling  more  in  his  being  cru- 
cified than  if  he  had  died  some  other  death  ? 

A.  Yes,  [there  is  ;]  for  thereby  I  am  assured  that  he 
took  on  him  the  curse  which  lay  upon  me  ;  for  the  death 
of  the  cross  was  accursed  of  God. 

EXPLANATIONS. 

a.  Crucified,  put  to  death  on  the  cross. 

b.  Curse,  sentence  of  divine  vengeance  on  sinners. 

c.  Cross,  a  gibbet  consisting  of  two  pieces  of  timber 
placed  across  each  other,  either  in  the  form  of  a  T,  or  an  X. 

DOCTRINES  SEPARATED  AND  PROVED. 

1.  Christ  died  on  the  cross.  Matt,  xxvii.  35 — And  they 
crucified  him,  and  parted  his  garments,  casting  lots.  Luke 
xxiii.  33 — And  when  they  were  come  to  the  place  which  is 
called  Calvary,  there  they  crucified  him. 

2.  There  is  more  in  Christ1  s  being  crucified,  than  if  he  had 
died  some  other  death.  Phil.  ii.  8,  9 — And  being  found  in 
fashion  as  a  man,  he  humbled  himself,  and  became  obedient 
unto  death,  even  the  death  of  the  cross.  Wherefore  God 
also  hath  highly  exalted  him,  and  given  him  a  name  which 
is  above  every  name. 

3.  We  as  sinners  are  wider  the  curse.  Gal.  iii.  10 — Cursed 
is  every  one  that  continueth  not  in  all  things  which  are 
written  in  the  book  of  the  law  to  do  them.  Deut.  xxvii.  26 
— Cursed  be  he  that  confirmeth  not  all  the  words  of  this 
law  to  do  them. 

4.  Christ  took  on  him  the  curse  which  lay  upon  us.  Gal.  iii. 
13 — Christ  hath  redeemed  us  from  the  curse  of  the  law,  be- 
ing made  a  curse  for  us. 

5.  The  death  of  the  cross  was  accursed  of  God.  Gal.  iii.  13 
— For  it  is  written.  Cursed  is  every  one  that  hangeth  on  a 
tree.  Deut.  xxi.  23 — For  he  that  is  hanged  is  accursed  of 
God.
