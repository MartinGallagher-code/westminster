Q.  11.  Is  not  God  then  also  merciful? 
A.  God  is  indeed  merciful,  but  also  just;  therefore  his 


, 
justice  requires  that  sin,  which  is  committed  against  the 
most  high  majesty  of  God,  be  also  punished  with  ex- 
treme, that  is,  with  everlasting  punishment,  both  of  body 
and  soul. 

EXPLANATIONS.

according  to  his  due. 

c.  Most  high,  exceedingly  exalted. 

d.  Majesty,  dignity,  sovereignty. 

e.  Extreme,  exceedingly  great. 

DOCTRINES  SEPARATED  AND  PROVED. 

1.  God  is  merciful.  Exod.  xxxiv.  6,  7 — The  Lord,  the 
Lord  God  merciful  and  gracious,  long  suffering,  and  abun- 
dant in  goodness  and  truth,  keeping  mercy  for  thousands, 
forgiving  iniquity,  and  transgression,  and  sin. 

2.  God  is  also  just.  Deut.  xxxii.  4 — A  God  of  truth  and 
without  iniquity,  just  and  right  is  he.  Ps.  lxxxix.  14 — 
Justice  and  judgment  are  the  habitation  of  thy  throne. 

3.  Sin  is  committed  against  God.  Ps.  li.  4 — Against  thee, 
thee  only  have  I  sinned  and  done  this  evil  in  thy  sight.  • 

4.  The  majesty  of  God  is  most  high.  1  Chron.  xxix.  11 — 
Thine,  0  Lord,  is  the  greatness,  and  the  power,  and  the 
glory,  and  the  victory,  and  the  majesty  ;  for  all  that  is  in 
the  heaven  and  in  the  earth  is  thine ;  thine  is  the  kingdom, 

0  Lord,  and  thou  art  exalted  as  head  above  all. 

5.  The  justice  of  God  requires  sin  to  be  punished.  Hab.  i. 
13 — Thou  art  of  purer  eyes  than  to  behold  evil,  and  canst 
not  look  on  iniquity.    Ps.  v.  4,  5.   Rom.  iii.  26 — To  declare, 

1  say,  at  this  time  his  righteousness  :  that  he  might  be  just, 
and  yet  the  justifier  of  him  which  believeth  in  Jesus.  Job 
xxiv.  10,  11. 

6.  The  punishment  of  sin  will  be  exceedingly  great.  Rev. 
xiv.  11 — And  the  smoke  of  their  torment  ascendeth  up  for 
ever  and  ever.  Mark  ix.  44,  46,  48 — Where  their  worm 
dieth  not,  and  the  fire  is  not  quenched. 

7.  The  punishment  of  sin  will  be  everlasting.  2  Thess.  i.  9 — 
Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting  destruction  from 
the  presence  of  the  Lord  and  from  the  glory  of  his  power. 
Matt,  xxv.  46 — And  these  shall  go  away  into  everlasting 
punishment. 
[Q.12. 


8.  The  punishment  of  sin  will  be  i?)flicted  both  upon  the  body 
and  the  soul.  Luke  xvi.  23,  24 — And  in  hell  he  lifted  up  his 
eyes,  being  in  torments,  and  seeth  Abraham  afar  off,  and 
Lazarus  in  his  bosom  :  And  he  cried  and  said,  Father  Abra- 
ham, have  mercy  on  me,  and  send  Lazarus,  that  he  may  dip 
the  tip  of  his  finger  in  water,  and  cool  my  tongue ;  for  I  am 
tormented  in  this  name.
