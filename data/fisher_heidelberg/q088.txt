DOCTRINES  SEPARATED  AND  PROVED. 

1.  True  conversion  includes  in  it  the  mortification  of  the  old 
man,  that  is,  our  corrupt  nature.  Rom.  vi.  6 — Knowing  this, 
that  our  old  man  is  crucified  with  him,  that  the  body  of  sin 
might  be  destroyed,  that  henceforth  we  should  not  serve 
sin.  1  Cor.  v.  7 — Purge  out  therefore  the  old  leaven,  that 
ye  may  be  a  new  lump,  as  ye  are  unleavened.  Col.  iii  9 
— Ye  have  put  off  the  old  man  with  his  deeds.  Col.  iii.  5. 
Eph.  iv.  22. 

2.  True  conversion  includes  in  it  also  the  quickening  of  the 
new  man,  that  is,  our  renewed  nature.  Eph.  iv.  28,  24 — And 
be  renewed  in  the  spirit  of  your  mind :  And  that  ye  put  on 
the  new  man,  which  after  God  is  created  in  righteousness 
and  true  holiness.  Col.  iii.  10 — And  ye  have  put  on  the 
new  man,  which  is  renewed  in  knowledge  after  the  image 
of  him  that  created  him.
