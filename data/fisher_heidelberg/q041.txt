DOCTRINES  SEPARATED  AND  PROVED. 

1.  Christ  was  buried.  Acts  xiii.  29 — And  when  they  had 
fulfilled  all  that  was  written  of  him,  they  took  him  down 
from  the  tree,  and  laid  him  in  a  sepulchre.  Luke  xxiii.  52, 
53 — This  man  went  unto  Pilate,  and  begged  the  body  of 
Jesus.  And  he  took  it  down,  and  wrapped  it  in  linen,  and 
laid  it  in  a  sepulchre  that  was  hewn  in  stone,  wherein  never 
man  before  was  laid. 

2.  Christ's  burial  proves  that  he  was  really  dead.  Mark 
xv.  43-46 — Joseph  of  Arimathea,  an  honorable  counsellor, 
which  also  waited  for  the  kingdom  of  God,  came,  and  went 
in  boldly  unto  Pilate,  and  craved  the  body  of  Jesus ;  and 
Pilate  marvelled  if  he  were  already  dead :  and  calling  unto 
him  the  centurion,  he  asked  him  whether  he  had  been  any 
while  dead.  And  when  he  knew  it  of  the  centurion,  he 
gave  the  body  to  Joseph.  And  he  bought  fine  linen,  and 
took  him  down,  and  wrapped  him  in  the  linen,  and  laid 
him  in  a  sepulchre  which  was  hewn  out  of  a  rock,  and  rolled 
a  stone  unto  the  door  of  the  sepulchre.
