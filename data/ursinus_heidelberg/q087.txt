This Question naturally grows out of the preceding one ; for since good works are the fruits of our regeneration — since they are the expression of our thankfulness to God, and the evidences of true faith ; and since none are saved but those in whom these things are found ; it follows, on the other hand, that evil works are the fruits of the flesh — that they are mani festations of ingratitude, and evidences of unbelief, so that no one that continues to produce them can be saved. Hence, all those who are not converted to God from their evil works, but continue in their sins, are con demned for ever, according to the following declarations of the word of God : " Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God ? be not deceived ; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, &c., shall inherit the kingdom of God." " Of the which I have told you in times past that they which do such things, shall not inherit the kingdom of God." " For this ye know ; that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God ; for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience." " He that loveth not his brother abideth in death." (1 Cor. 6 : 9. Gal. 5 : 21. Eph. 5 : 5, 6. 1 John 3 : 14.)

We may also observe, that another reason for good works may be de duced from the consequence which results from evil works ; viz., that all those who perform evil works, and continue in their wicked and ungrateful lives, cannot be saved, inasmuch as they are destitute of true faith, and conversion.
