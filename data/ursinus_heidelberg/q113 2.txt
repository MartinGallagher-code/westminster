Obj. 3. Sin renders man obnoxious to the eternal wrath of God. Con cupiscence does not expose those who are regenerated to the wrath of God : for there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus. (Rom. 8:1.) Therefore, concupiscence is no sin, at least not in the regenerate. Ans. There is a fallacy of accident in the minor proposition ; for that concupiscence does not condemn the regenerate, comes to pass by an acci dent, which is the grace of God, which does not impute it to the faithful. This, however, does not occur in this way, as though concupiscence were no sin ; for other sins in like manner do not condemn the regenerate, not because they are no sins, but because they have obtained the pardon of them through Christ.

Obj. 4. Original sin is removed in baptism. Therefore, concupiscence is no sin in those who are baptized. We reply to the antecedent, that orig inal sin is not simply and wholly removed in baptism ; but merely as it respects its guilt. Corruption and an inclination to sin remain still in those who are baptized. This is what the Schoolmen mean, when they say, The formal part of sin is removed, but the material remains. Should any one reply, that where the formal part of sin is removed, there the thing itself is removed, inasmuch as the form gives being to the thing ; so that original sin itself must be removed in baptism ; we answer, that there is here an error in understanding that to be spoken generally, which is true only in a certain respect. The formal part of sin is removed, not simply, but in re spect to the guilt of sin ; for the formal part of sin is two-fold, and in cludes, 1. Opposition to the law, and an inclination to sin. 2. Guilt, or desert of punishment. The guilt of sin is removed, but the inclination remains. " I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind." (Rom. 7 : 23.^
