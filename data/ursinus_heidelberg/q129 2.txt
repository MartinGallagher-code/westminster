The word Amen is not added, as a part of the prayer ; but is connected with it to denote, 1. A true and sincere desire that we may be heard, that the thing which we desire and pray for may be ratified and certain, and that God would answer our request. 2. A certainty and profession of our confidence, or a confirmation of our faith, by which we are fully persuaded that we shall be heard. The word Amen signifies, therefore, 1. So let it be, or let that come to pass which we ask. 2. May God, who is not un mindful of his promise certainly and truly hear us.

FINIS.

SOLI DEO SIT GLORIA.
